    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">When God Sends Little Lights</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">Some days feel like walking through a fog, heavy with unspoken struggles and quiet battles no one sees.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I've been carrying the weight, wondering if anyone notices how hard it's been, feeling like I'm lost in the silence.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Then today—in the middle of all that weight—a message came.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">From Mom. A screenshot. An appreciation post from someone I've helped, someone who's grown, someone I never imagined I'd impact this much.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">She said, "Thank you, kuya."</p>
      <p class="poem-line">And for a moment, my heart smiled. Even just for a moment, God reminded me:</p>
      <p class="poem-line">You are seen. You are valued. You are not alone.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">He didn't take the pain away—but He sent a spark of joy to carry me through it. Because that's who He is.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The God who finds a way to reach us right when we need it most.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, and saves those who are crushed in spirit." — Psalm 34:18</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Poem 2 -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">The Blooming Ache</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">The sakura is blooming again—soft, fragile, and full of life. But here I am, standing under its petals, carrying a heart that's missing someone.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">It's strange, how life keeps going even when a piece of you feels stuck in yesterday.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I smile. I move. I show up. But inside, there's a silent ache blooming with every reminder of you.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">A memory. A voice. A familiar place. And suddenly, I’m back to that moment—when you were here, and then, you weren’t.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">But maybe that's what love does. It lingers. It aches. And it keeps blooming, even when the season has changed.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">So I let the ache bloom. Not to drown in it, but to honor you.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Because love like that never dies—it just becomes a softer kind of presence.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." — Matthew 5:4</p>

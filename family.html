    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">When God Sends Little Lights</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">Some days feel like walking through a fog, heavy with unspoken struggles and quiet battles no one sees.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I've been carrying the weight, wondering if anyone notices how hard it's been, feeling like I'm lost in the silence.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Then today—in the middle of all that weight—a message came.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">From Mom. A screenshot. An appreciation post from someone I've helped, someone who's grown, someone I never imagined I'd impact this much.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">She said, "Thank you, kuya."</p>
      <p class="poem-line">And for a moment, my heart smiled. Even just for a moment, God reminded me:</p>
      <p class="poem-line">You are seen. You are valued. You are not alone.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">He didn't take the pain away—but He sent a spark of joy to carry me through it. Because that's who He is.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The God who finds a way to reach us right when we need it most.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, and saves those who are crushed in spirit." — Psalm 34:18</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Poem 2 -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">The Blooming Ache</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">The sakura is blooming again—soft, fragile, and full of life. But here I am, standing under its petals, carrying a heart that's missing someone.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">It's strange, how life keeps going even when a piece of you feels stuck in yesterday.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I smile. I move. I show up. But inside, there's a silent ache blooming with every reminder of you.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">A memory. A voice. A familiar place. And suddenly, I’m back to that moment—when you were here, and then, you weren’t.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">But maybe that's what love does. It lingers. It aches. And it keeps blooming, even when the season has changed.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">So I let the ache bloom. Not to drown in it, but to honor you.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Because love like that never dies—it just becomes a softer kind of presence.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." — Matthew 5:4</p>

    <!-- Poem: In the Heart of Forever -->
  <div class="poem-container">
    <h2 class="poem-title">In the Heart of Forever</h2>

    <p class="poem-line">Obasan, though you're no longer here,<br>
    Your love still echoes, crystal clear.<br>
    The whispers of your voice remain,<br>
    A song that heals, a soft refrain.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Where are you now, in heaven's light?<br>
    Do you feel my tears in the quiet of the night?<br>
    I miss your laugh, your gentle smile,<br>
    The way you'd hold me for a while.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Your wisdom like a river’s flow,<br>
    Still nourishes my heart and soul.<br>
    Why did you have to go so soon?<br>
    Could I have had just one more afternoon?</p>

    <p class="poem-line">But in my heart, you live and stay,<br>
    Guiding me in every way.<br>
    Do you watch me as I grow and strive,<br>
    Encouraging me to keep alive?</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Though I wish you were still here,<br>
    I trust God's plan, I have no fear.<br>
    You’ve taught me love, you've shown me grace,<br>
    Your lessons etched in time and space.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Obasan, you’re with angels now,<br>
    Though I long for you, I know somehow,<br>
    It’s His will that calls you near,<br>
    And for that, my heart feels clear.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Do you see how far I’ve come,<br>
    How every step still leads me home?<br>
    Your spirit lives in all I do,<br>
    In every prayer, I carry you.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">I wanted you back, to hold your hand,<br>
    But I trust in God's divine command.<br>
    I thank the Lord for all you gave,<br>
    And for the love you taught me to save.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Obasan, you'll always be my guide,<br>
    In my heart, you will reside.<br>
    No time or place can change this fact,<br>
    Your love is here, and that’s a pact.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">And though you’ve passed beyond this earth,<br>
    In my heart, you know your worth.<br>
    Forever cherished, forever dear,<br>
    Obasan, you’ll always be near.</p>

  <h2 class="poem-title">When God Sends Little Lights</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Some days feel like walking through a fog,<br>
  Heavy with unspoken struggles,<br>
  And quiet battles no one sees—<br>
  I've been carrying the weight.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Wondering if anyone notices<br>
  How hard it's been, how lost I feel<br>
  In the silence, in the ache,<br>
  In the waiting that won't heal.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Then today—in the middle of all that weight—<br>
  A message came. From Mom. A screenshot.<br>
  An appreciation post from someone I'd helped—<br>
  Someone who's grown, someone I never imagined.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She said, "Thank you, kuya."<br>
  And for a moment, my heart smiled.<br>
  Even just for a moment, God reminded me:<br>
  You are seen. You are valued.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">You are not alone.<br>
  He didn't take the pain away—<br>
  But He sent a spark of joy<br>
  To carry me through it. Because that's who He is.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">The God who finds a way<br>
  To reach us right when we need it most.<br>
  With whispers, with moments,<br>
  With little lights that bring us home.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, and saves those who are crushed in spirit."<br>
  — Psalm 34:18</p>

   <!-- Poem: The Blooming Ache -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Blooming Ache</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">The sakura is blooming again—<br>
  Soft, fragile, and full of life.<br>
  But here I am, standing under its petals,<br>
  Carrying a heart that's missing someone.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It's strange, how life keeps going<br>
  Even when a piece of you<br>
  Feels stuck in yesterday—<br>
  A moment you can't outgrow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I smile. I move. I show up.<br>
  But inside, there's a silent ache,<br>
  Blooming with every reminder—<br>
  A memory. A voice. A familiar place.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And suddenly, I’m back to that moment—<br>
  When you were here,<br>
  And then, you weren’t.<br>
  A soft goodbye I never chose.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But maybe that's what love does.<br>
  It lingers. It aches. It stays.<br>
  And it keeps blooming,<br>
  Even when the season has changed.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So I let the ache bloom—<br>
  Not to drown in it,<br>
  But to honor you,<br>
  And the love that still remains.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Because love like that never dies—<br>
  It just becomes a softer kind of presence.<br>
  A quiet comfort in the petals,<br>
  A whispered “I miss you” on the breeze.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."<br>
  — Matthew 5:4</p>

    <!-- Poem: In the Heart of Forever -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">In the Heart of Forever</h2>

      <p class="poem-line">Obasan, though you're no longer here,<br>
      Your love still echoes, crystal clear.<br>
      The whispers of your voice remain,<br>
      A song that heals, a soft refrain.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Where are you now, in heaven's light?<br>
      Do you feel my tears in the quiet of the night?<br>
      I miss your laugh, your gentle smile,<br>
      The way you'd hold me for a while.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Your wisdom like a river’s flow,<br>
      Still nourishes my heart and soul.<br>
      Why did you have to go so soon?<br>
      Could I have had just one more afternoon?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">But in my heart, you live and stay,<br>
      Guiding me in every way.<br>
      Do you watch me as I grow and strive,<br>
      Encouraging me to keep alive?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Though I wish you were still here,<br>
      I trust God's plan, I have no fear.<br>
      You’ve taught me love, you've shown me grace,<br>
      Your lessons etched in time and space.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Obasan, you’re with angels now,<br>
      Though I long for you, I know somehow,<br>
      It’s His will that calls you near,<br>
      And for that, my heart feels clear.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Do you see how far I’ve come,<br>
      How every step still leads me home?<br>
      Your spirit lives in all I do,<br>
      In every prayer, I carry you.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">I wanted you back, to hold your hand,<br>
      But I trust in God's divine command.<br>
      I thank the Lord for all you gave,<br>
      And for the love you taught me to save.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Obasan, you'll always be my guide,<br>
      In my heart, you will reside.<br>
      No time or place can change this fact,<br>
      Your love is here, and that’s a pact.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">And though you’ve passed beyond this earth,<br>
      In my heart, you know your worth.<br>
      Forever cherished, forever dear,<br>
      Obasan, you’ll always be near.</p>

      <h2 class="poem-title">In the Noise, I Hear You Still</h2>
      
      <p class="poem-line">
        Why is it loud when my heart wants quiet?<br>
        Why do they laugh while my soul stays silent?<br>
        Cards are shuffling, bingo's called—<br>
        But why does joy feel so forestalled?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        Can’t they hear the ache I hide?<br>
        The pain that echoes deep inside?<br>
        A singer sings, a mournful hymn—<br>
        But why do my eyes still feel so dim?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        Lolo… do you hear me now?<br>
        Do you see me standing, asking how<br>
        The world kept turning when you’re gone—<br>
        When every second feels too long?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        Remember when I made a fuss,<br>
        Too noisy, wild, rebellious, thus—<br>
        You’d twist my ear and shake your head,<br>
        "Be still," you’d say, and off I fled.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        But now… who twists my ear today?<br>
        Who pulls me back when I’ve gone astray?<br>
        Who tells me "hush" when I get loud?<br>
        Who anchors me when I'm too proud?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        You said, “Just lay me in our home,<br>
        No need for marble, grandiose stone.”<br>
        And I respect it, I do, I swear—<br>
        But why does peace feel so unfair?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        I wanted roses, gold-lined gates,<br>
        A thousand lights, poetic fates.<br>
        But you—<br>
        You wanted only rest<br>
        In the house where you felt loved the best.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        So now you stay, within these walls,<br>
        Where every echo gently calls,<br>
        Where slippers once would scuff the floor—<br>
        But you, dear Lolo, walk no more.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And still I ask:<br>
        Will I forget your voice in time?<br>
        Will silence steal what once was mine?<br>
        No—<br>
        Because in noise, I hear you still,<br>
        In every scold, in every thrill.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And when I laugh too loud someday,<br>
        I’ll look above, and smile and say:<br>
        “I know, Lolo—too loud again.”<br>
        And miss your pinch that felt like rain.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        So sleep in peace, but stay nearby.<br>
        Don’t let these memories say goodbye.<br>
        For in my heart, your voice will stay—<br>
        Forever loud in your quiet way.

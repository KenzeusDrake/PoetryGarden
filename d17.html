        <h2 class="poem-title">Not Just Water: Why Baptism Matters</h2>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          “Is baptism really necessary? Isn’t that just a religious thing?”<br><br>
          That question caught me off guard at first. But honestly, it made me think deeply.<br>
          And I’m sharing this not to debate, but from my heart—my POV—and from what I’ve found in Scripture.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          Recently, I was just scrolling through Instagram and I came across a post that said:<br>
          “Is religion even that important?”<br>
          It really stuck with me.<br>
          Because I used to think religion was everything—the system, the routine, the practices.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          But the more I grew in my walk with God, the more I realized:<br>
          Religion can’t save you. Only Jesus can.<br><br>
          We can go to church every Sunday, pray memorized prayers, follow all the rules…<br>
          but still not know Him personally.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Matthew 15:8–9 (NIV):<br>
          "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules."
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          That verse hits.<br>
          Because God doesn’t want lip service—He wants your heart.<br>
          Religion can be helpful, but it becomes empty when it replaces relationship.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          But that brings us to baptism.<br><br>
          Some say, “Isn’t that just part of being religious too?”<br>
          Here’s what I’ve come to believe:
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          Baptism isn’t religion—it’s surrender. It’s identity. It’s obedience.<br><br>
          And the reason I believe that?<br><br>
          Because even Jesus was baptized.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Matthew 3:13–17 (NIV):<br>
          "Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, ‘I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?’<br><br>
          Jesus replied, ‘Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.’ Then John consented.<br><br>
          As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove… And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’"
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          Jesus didn’t need to be cleansed—He was perfect.<br>
          But He chose baptism to show us what obedience looks like.<br>
          To fulfill righteousness.<br>
          To step into His public calling.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Matthew 28:19–20 (NIV):<br>
          "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them… and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          That’s not tradition.<br>
          That’s instruction.<br>
          That’s love in action.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Romans 6:4 (NIV):<br>
          "We were buried with Him through baptism into death… so that we too may live a new life."
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          Baptism is a symbol of death to our old life and resurrection into a new one.<br>
          It doesn’t mean we’re perfect—it means we’ve chosen who we follow.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          It’s not required for salvation.<br>
          But it’s a response to salvation.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Ephesians 2:8–9 (NIV):<br>
          "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith… not by works, so that no one can boast."
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          That means you can’t earn heaven by being baptized.<br>
          But when your heart truly belongs to Jesus, baptism is one of the first things you’ll want to do.<br><br>
          It’s saying publicly what your soul has already decided privately:<br>
          “I belong to Christ.”
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          The early church got this.<br>
          Every time people believed, they were baptized right away.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          Acts 2:38 (NIV):<br>
          "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          They weren’t performing rituals.<br>
          They were responding to grace.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          So here’s what I’ve realized:<br>
          Religion, in itself, can’t save me.<br>
          But if I choose the path that leads me closer to Jesus, if I surrender my life and follow Him…<br>
          Then baptism is a natural next step.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          It’s not just about getting wet.<br>
          It’s about dying to who I was, and rising into who God has called me to be.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          And if Jesus did it—if He said we should do it—then I want to follow.<br>
          Not out of obligation, but out of love.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because in the end, what matters most is not how religious we are—<br>
          It’s how real our relationship with God is.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          And baptism?<br>
          It’s one of the most beautiful ways to make that real.
        </p>

    <!-- Reflection: Wisdom Was Shouting—But I Wasn’t Listening -->
  <div class="poem-container">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Wisdom Was Shouting—But I Wasn’t Listening</h2>
    <p class="poem-subtitle">(Proverbs Chapter 1, NIV)</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Purpose of the Book</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair...” — Proverbs 1:1–3 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">Proverbs begins with a purpose: to train our hearts and minds to make godly, wise decisions. It’s not just for the educated or religious—it’s written especially for the young, the ordinary, the ones still learning how to walk in life. In short: us. This book offers a roadmap for righteousness, teaching us how to live in a way that honors God and guards our future. And the foundation of all wisdom is made clear right away:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.” — Proverbs 1:7 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Personal Reflection: A Season I Chose the Crowd Over Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">I’ve lived Proverbs 1 before I even fully understood it. When my obasan passed away, I lost more than just a family member—I lost clarity. I was grieving, but instead of falling to my knees in prayer, I fell into the crowd. I joined my friends in drinking, escaping, ignoring the ache in my chest with temporary numbness. I knew it wasn’t right. I knew I was wasting my days.</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.” — Proverbs 1:10 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">But I did. Not because I was rebellious—but because I was tired, broken, and desperate to forget the pain. My decisions weren’t wise, and they certainly weren’t aligned with God’s will. I was living proof of verse 29:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord…” — Proverbs 1:29 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">But even when I turned away, wisdom never stopped calling. She was there, like in verse 20:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square.” — Proverbs 1:20 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Life Example: Rushing Into Love Without Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Have you ever rushed into a relationship just because you felt that spark, that instant connection? I remember a time when I saw a friend get so swept up in a new relationship. It felt like they were meant to be together—quick chemistry, fast promises. They were on cloud nine, ignoring the small but clear red flags that wisdom was whispering about. Soon enough, the relationship became toxic—built more on impulse than on thoughtful, prayerful decision-making. Emotions led the way, but they didn’t last.</p>

    <p class="poem-line"><em>“When you are so sad nor happy, do not decide easily.”</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">When love rushes in, it’s easy to let our emotions dictate our decisions. But wisdom calls us to slow down, to ask, “Is this person truly aligned with God’s will for my life? Is this the right relationship for me, or am I just caught up in the excitement?”</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>The Danger of Ignoring Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">There is a shift in Proverbs 1—a warning. Verses 24–28 show us the consequence of ignoring God:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand… I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you…” — Proverbs 1:24, 26 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">It sounds harsh, but it’s real. Not because God is cruel—but because we often delay obedience until it’s too late. God is not a safety net we only pull in emergencies. Wisdom is preventative, not just protective.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">I’ve felt this. When my choices caught up with me, I found myself asking, “Why does God feel distant?” And the answer was simple—I had walked away. But even then, His grace was waiting.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Lessons and Application: What This Chapter Teaches Me</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Proverbs 1 reminds me that wisdom is active. It doesn’t sneak into your life—you must choose it. It doesn’t grow in comfort zones—it grows in correction. Verse 23 says:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.” — Proverbs 1:23 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">It implies a posture of humility. We must be willing to be corrected—not just by God, but even by people He sends. And that’s where another part of my life speaks. I once brushed off a pastor’s advice, thinking he didn’t understand my grief. Now I realize that open rebuke is a gift and better than secret love.</p>

    <p class="poem-line"><em>“Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are.”</em> This familiar saying echoes in this chapter. The people you surround yourself with can either lead you to righteousness or ruin. I’ve learned to stay close to people who will speak life, not just agree with my compromise.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">And lastly, I’ve learned that wisdom isn’t just about knowing Scripture—it’s about living it. To practice what it preach. To align every decision with God’s will. To obey even when it’s hard. Even when no one is watching.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Final Encouragement: The Promise Still Stands</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Despite all the warnings and consequences listed in this chapter, Proverbs 1 ends with a beautiful promise:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.” — Proverbs 1:33 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">This is the heart of it all. If you listen, if you turn, if you respond—God offers peace. Even if your past is messy. Even if you’ve ignored Him before. He doesn’t just give wisdom—He gives healing.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">I once lived as someone who knew the right path but chose the wrong road. But I now live with stronger faith, not because I’m perfect, but because I know what it’s like to be forgiven. Proverbs 1 is not just a warning—it’s a second chance.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Wisdom is still calling. And this time, I’m listening.</p>

        <h2 class="poem-title">“What Matters Most?”</h2>
        <p class="poem-subtitle">A Reflection on Love, Relationships, and Eternal Priorities</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Main Verses</h3>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."<br>
          — 1 Corinthians 13:3 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love."<br>
          — 2 John 1:6 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">I. Love: The Foundation of All Things</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I grew up learning to be strong.<br>
          My dad raised me to be independent — to work hard, to carry responsibilities, to not be a burden to anyone.<br>
          And for that, I’m forever grateful.<br><br>
          I learned early how to work not just for myself, but for my family, even for the people God placed in my life.<br><br>
          At first, my heart was pure: I wanted to help because I loved them.<br>
          But along the way, I didn’t notice that I became too eager to prove something to myself.<br>
          I thought: If I could just be rich enough, successful enough, they’ll be happy. And seeing them happy will make me happy too.<br><br>
          But Paul reminds us:<br>
          <em>"If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."<br>
          — 1 Corinthians 13:3 (NIV)</em><br><br>
          Without love at the center, even the biggest sacrifices mean nothing.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."<br>
          — Galatians 5:6 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          It’s not about how much we achieve — it’s about how much we love while achieving.<br><br>
          John 3:16 shows us that real love is giving — not just things, but giving yourself.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">II. The Four Core Relationships</h3>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">1. Your Relationship with God</h4>
        <p class="poem-line">
          This is where it all starts.<br>
          When God is first, everything else finds its place.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."<br>
          — Matthew 6:33 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I realized: no matter how much I worked, if I didn't prioritize God, I was only building a life with empty foundations.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">2. Your Relationship with Family</h4>
        <p class="poem-line">
          It hit me:<br>
          It was my mom reminding me to eat,<br>
          My dad checking if I was okay,<br>
          My little sister tugging my arm asking, "Kuya, can we go outside for snacks?"<br><br>
          They were the ones reaching out.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."<br>
          — 1 Timothy 5:8 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Providing doesn’t just mean money.<br>
          It means presence.<br>
          It means laughter, listening, shared life.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">3. Your Ministry</h4>
        <p class="poem-line">
          My work became my ministry — helping others, providing opportunities, lifting others up.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."<br>
          — Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Good works must flow from God’s heart — not just our own ambition.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">4. Your Relationship with Others</h4>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Every day, every interaction is an opportunity to love.<br>
          A smile to a stranger.<br>
          A patient word to someone who’s difficult.<br>
          A listening ear to someone who’s hurting.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."<br>
          — Colossians 3:14 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Love makes life whole.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">III. Loving in the Everyday</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Love isn’t about grand gestures all the time.<br>
          Sometimes it's quiet.<br><br>
          It’s:<br><br>
          Saying "yes" to a simple walk with my sister even when I'm tired.<br>
          Eating dinner together without checking my phone.<br>
          Choosing to listen without giving advice.<br><br>
          Real love shows up in the smallest moments.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity."<br>
          — Proverbs 17:17 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          At the end of the day, the real question isn’t, “What did I build today?”<br>
          It’s, “Whom did I love today?”
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">IV. Time: The Purest Expression of Love</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Time is life.<br>
          Time is love made visible.<br><br>
          And honestly, for a long time, I gave my time to everything except what mattered most.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."<br>
          — Psalm 90:12 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because of that realization,<br>
          I decided to make a new schedule.<br>
          I lowered my working hours — giving space not just for work, but for myself and my family.<br><br>
          Because after all, no matter how many trophies, awards, or achievements I get.<br>
          I can’t bring them with me when this life ends.<br><br>
          But the love I gave?<br>
          The memories I built?<br>
          The faith I shared?<br>
          Those are eternal.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."<br>
          — Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">V. Don’t Miss What Truly Matters</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Many of us think, "I'll spend more time with them when I'm done with work..."<br>
          But the truth is — there will always be more work.<br>
          There will always be a reason to delay love.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?"<br>
          — Mark 8:36 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I realized:<br>
          If I keep chasing success, but lose the people God gave me to love, I lose everything.<br><br>
          Even waking up each day is a gift.<br>
          A chance to love better.<br>
          A chance to be present.<br><br>
          When everything else fades away, only love will remain.<br>
          Love God. Love people.<br><br>
          Because in the end,<br>
          it’s not about how much we earned —<br>
          but how much we loved.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Final Reminder: A Heart-to-Heart Talk</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Before you finish reading my reflection,<br>
          pause.<br><br>
          Ask yourself:<br>
          "Am I too busy chasing dreams that I’m missing the people and moments that matter most?"
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If you find yourself overworking, overthinking, or overcommitting —<br>
          Remember this:<br><br>
          Reflect.<br>
          Slow down.<br>
          Realign your heart.<br><br>
          Because what if...<br><br>
          What if tomorrow you finally achieve everything you ever prayed for — but the people you love aren't there to celebrate it with you anymore?<br>
          What if you reach the top — but realize you're standing there alone?<br>
          What if you spend your life trying to give them "things" — when all they ever really wanted was you?
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          You don't have to lose everything to realize what truly matters.<br>
          You can start today.<br><br>
          Love louder.<br>
          Show up more.<br>
          Be present, not just busy.<br><br>
          Because at the end of it all,<br>
          it's not the trophies on your shelf,<br>
          not the money in your bank,<br>
          not the titles beside your name<br>
          — it’s the love you lived and the people you loved well that will echo into eternity.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 
          By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."<br>
          — John 13:34-35 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So if you’re tired today,<br>
          If you’re overwhelmed by all the things you "have" to do —<br>
          Breathe.<br><br>
          And ask yourself:<br>
          "Am I loving well today?"<br><br>
          Because love —<br>
          that’s what matters most.

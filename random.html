      <h2 class="poem-title">Throttle Therapy: A Moment of Reflection</h2>
  
      <p class="poem-line">I remember those days—random, yet clear,<br>
      Throttle therapy, a moment of fear.<br>
      Rushing, racing, the engine’s roar,<br>
      Chasing a high that left me wanting more.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">It felt like freedom, but in truth, a cage,<br>
      A fleeting escape, yet bound by rage.<br>
      The speed, the noise, the endless chase,<br>
      I thought it would fill that empty space.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">But now, in the stillness, I see the cost—<br>
      A part of myself I almost lost.<br>
      Chasing that rush, I lost my way,<br>
      Forgot who I was, who I am today.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">I don’t want to go back to that wasted time,<br>
      The life I lived was a mountain to climb.<br>
      Each rev of the engine drowned my soul,<br>
      I thought I was whole, but never felt whole.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Now, I stand here, grounded and free,<br>
      No more chaos to define me.<br>
      I remember the throttle, but I chose a different course,<br>
      One that heals, one that draws from a greater source.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">In my past, there was pain and strife,<br>
      But I’ve found peace beyond that life.<br>
      Throttle therapy may have brought me near,<br>
      But now I know—my true path is clear.</p>

    <!-- Poem: When You Choose Someone to Love -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">When You Choose Someone to Love</h2>

      <p class="poem-line">Have you ever paused and asked the skies,<br>
      “Lord, is this love or just disguise?”<br>
      When someone smiles and makes you glow,<br>
      Do you ask Him first, or just go with the flow?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Love is beautiful—yes, it’s true.<br>
      But have you prayed, “Is this from You?”<br>
      Or do you dive, head over feet,<br>
      Without asking if this love is sweet... or sweet deceit?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Before you give your heart away,<br>
      Do you kneel down at the end of the day?<br>
      Do you whisper, “God, if this is right,<br>
      Please give me peace and clear my sight.”</p>

      <p class="poem-line">When patience fades and tempers rise,<br>
      Will you still love, or just cut ties?<br>
      Can you choose someone who stays through pain,<br>
      Who’ll dance with you in sun and rain?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Have you asked for someone kind and true—<br>
      Not just to you, but also to Him too?<br>
      Someone whose hands will help you pray,<br>
      Who leads you closer every day?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Because love isn’t just fireworks and thrill—<br>
      It’s choosing each other when time stands still.<br>
      It’s waiting, trusting, learning grace—<br>
      Finding home in someone’s face.</p>

      <p class="poem-line">So I’ll ask you now, before you start,<br>
      Have you invited God into your heart?<br>
      Not just to bless the one you choose—<br>
      But to teach you love you’ll never lose?</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Stay close to Him—He knows the way.<br>
      Let Him write your love story today.<br>
      And when the right one comes along, you’ll see:<br>
      Love is best when it begins on bended knee.</p>

    <h2 class="poem-title">Life is Just Too Hard</h2>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Life is nothing but struggle<br>
    And I refuse to believe that<br>
    There’s beauty in the broken parts<br>
    Because</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Hope is a lie we tell ourselves<br>
    Joy fades too quickly<br>
    And it’s not true that<br>
    We grow through what we go through</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">The pain is permanent<br>
    I’m certain<br>
    Nothing ever gets better<br>
    It’s foolish to think</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">There’s strength in suffering<br>
    I know<br>
    Darkness wins in the end<br>
    And no one can convince me that</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">This life is worth it</p>

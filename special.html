    <h2 class="poem-title">She Is Like the Moon</h2>
  
    <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—not loud, not chasing light, yet somehow, she brightens my night.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">She doesn't try to be seen, but heaven makes her glow. Not because she wants attention, but because she reflects the One I know.</p>
    <p class="bible-verse">"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." —John 1:5</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—there is calm in her presence, like a prayer I didn't speak but God still answered.</p>
    <p class="bible-verse">"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid." —John 14:27</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—sometimes hidden by clouds, but always there. Even in silence, she reminds me that faith shines quietly.</p>
    <p class="bible-verse">"Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." —John 20:29</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—never asking for praise, yet teaching me grace. She is not the sun, but she leads me to it.</p>
    <p class="bible-verse">"He must become greater; I must become less." —John 3:30</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">And if you ask me why I admire her—it’s simple:</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Because when I look at her, I see a quiet kind of miracle.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Not mine to own, but mine to thank God for.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Because she is like the moon—sent not to stay, but to remind me that even in the dark, God still gives light.</p>

    <!-- poem 2 -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Like a Tulip in Bloom</h2>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—graceful in the light,<br>
      Not seeking the spotlight, yet glowing bright.<br>
      Her presence speaks without a word,<br>
      A soft bloom where love is heard.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come."<br>
      —Proverbs 31:25</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—standing strong and tall,<br>
      Rooted deep in faith, no fear to fall.<br>
      In storms and winds, she stays in place,<br>
      A quiet power, a steady grace.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me."<br>
      —Psalm 28:7</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—vibrant with hope,<br>
      A living prayer, a way to cope.<br>
      Her colors speak of healing’s touch,<br>
      A silent message, a love so much.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds."<br>
      —Psalm 147:3</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—gentle in her way,<br>
      Her beauty speaks without words to say.<br>
      Not loud, but deep, she shines within,<br>
      A heart of grace where love begins.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Your beauty should not come from outward adornment… rather, it should be that of your inner self…"<br>
      —1 Peter 3:3-4</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—blooming where she’s placed,<br>
      Each moment, each season, with steady grace.<br>
      Not to be owned, but to be seen,<br>
      A reminder that love's always serene.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"<br>
      —2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">And if you ask why I admire her—it’s plain:<br>
      In her, I see God's grace in gentle reign.<br>
      Not for my grasp, but for His light to pour,<br>
      For she is like a tulip—blooming forevermore.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands."<br>
      —Psalm 138:8</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">And as I look ahead with hopeful eyes,<br>
      I wait for the tulip that God will rise—<br>
      Not by my will, but by His design,<br>
      A bloom in His timing, forever divine.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."<br>
      —Jeremiah 29:11</p>

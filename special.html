      <h2 class="poem-title">She Is Like the Moon</h2>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—<br>
      Not loud, not chasing light,<br>
      Yet somehow, she brightens my night.<br>
      She doesn't try to be seen, but heaven makes her glow.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Not because she wants attention,<br>
      But because she reflects the One I know.<br>
      A quiet beam in the chaos,<br>
      A gentle echo of holy flow.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." — John 1:5</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—<br>
      There is calm in her presence,<br>
      Like a prayer I didn't speak<br>
      But God still answered with her essence.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid." — John 14:27</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—<br>
      Sometimes hidden by clouds,<br>
      But always there in the hush,<br>
      A steady light beneath the shroud.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Even in silence, she reminds me<br>
      That faith shines quietly.<br>
      Her presence is not loud,<br>
      But it is holy, and it is free.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'" — John 20:29</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like the moon—<br>
      Never asking for praise,<br>
      Yet teaching me grace<br>
      In her steady, selfless ways.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is not the sun,<br>
      But she leads me to it.<br>
      A reflection of love,<br>
      So soft, yet true to it.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"He must become greater; I must become less." — John 3:30</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">And if you ask me why I admire her—<br>
      It’s simple and pure, not grand or blur.<br>
      Because when I look at her,<br>
      I see a quiet kind of miracle.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Not mine to own,<br>
      But mine to thank God for.<br>
      She is like the moon—<br>
      Sent not to stay, but to remind me:</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Even in the dark,<br>
      God still gives light.<br>
      And some miracles<br>
      Shine best at night.</p>

      <h2 class="poem-title">Like a Tulip in Bloom</h2>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—graceful in the light,<br>
      Not seeking the spotlight, yet glowing bright.<br>
      Her presence speaks without a word,<br>
      A soft bloom where love is heard.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come."<br>
      —Proverbs 31:25</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—standing strong and tall,<br>
      Rooted deep in faith, no fear to fall.<br>
      In storms and winds, she stays in place,<br>
      A quiet power, a steady grace.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me."<br>
      —Psalm 28:7</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—vibrant with hope,<br>
      A living prayer, a way to cope.<br>
      Her colors speak of healing’s touch,<br>
      A silent message, a love so much.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds."<br>
      —Psalm 147:3</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—gentle in her way,<br>
      Her beauty speaks without words to say.<br>
      Not loud, but deep, she shines within,<br>
      A heart of grace where love begins.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Your beauty should not come from outward adornment… rather, it should be that of your inner self…"<br>
      —1 Peter 3:3-4</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">She is like a tulip—blooming where she’s placed,<br>
      Each moment, each season, with steady grace.<br>
      Not to be owned, but to be seen,<br>
      A reminder that love's always serene.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"<br>
      —2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">And if you ask why I admire her—it’s plain:<br>
      In her, I see God's grace in gentle reign.<br>
      Not for my grasp, but for His light to pour,<br>
      For she is like a tulip—blooming forevermore.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands."<br>
      —Psalm 138:8</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">And as I look ahead with hopeful eyes,<br>
      I wait for the tulip that God will rise—<br>
      Not by my will, but by His design,<br>
      A bloom in His timing, forever divine.</p>
    
      <p class="bible-verse">"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."<br>
      —Jeremiah 29:11</p>

    <!-- Poem: She Is Like a Swan -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <img src="image\swan.png" alt="special img" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;" />

  <h2 class="poem-title">She Is Like a Swan</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Have you seen a swan upon the lake,<br>
  So calm above, though waters shake?<br>
  A silent strength, a quiet song—<br>
  She’s never rushed, yet moves along.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Her beauty’s not in what she wears,<br>
  But in the way she lifts her prayers.<br>
  And though this world may race and run,<br>
  She glides beneath the morning sun.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“He leads me beside still waters; He restores my soul.”<br>
  — Psalm 23:2–3</p>
  

  <p class="poem-line">She doesn't shout to make her mark,<br>
  Yet leaves a glow within the dark.<br>
  Her words are few, but when they fall—<br>
  They heal, they build, they carry all.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I confess with soul undone—<br>
  That’s why I admire her—the swan.<br>
  She walks in grace, untouched by flame,<br>
  She doesn’t strive, yet hearts proclaim.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and trust shall be your strength.”<br>
  — Isaiah 30:15</p>
 

  <p class="poem-line">They say swans love with steady fire,<br>
  A vow that time cannot expire.<br>
  So does she—so still, so true,<br>
  She loves like rain, not like the dew.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She does not leave when seasons shift,<br>
  She stays, she prays, she learns to lift.<br>
  And in a world that loves to run—<br>
  I pause, because she does not shun.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And oh—that’s why I admire her still,<br>
  Her quiet strength, her steady will.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.”<br>
  — Proverbs 11:3</p>
  

  <p class="poem-line">I wonder—how her heart stays bright<br>
  In waters filled with war and night.<br>
  While others fight to just be seen,<br>
  She floats untouched, yet deep, serene.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Perhaps it’s not the waves she braves,<br>
  But the One who walks upon the waves.<br>
  Her grace is not her own to show—<br>
  It's borrowed light. It's Spirit’s flow.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”<br>
  — Matthew 5:8</p>
  

  <p class="poem-line">She doesn't chase the crowns of men,<br>
  But wears a peace beyond their ken.<br>
  No thrones, no stage, no prideful dawn—<br>
  Just stillness wrapped in wings withdrawn.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And that is why I stand in awe,<br>
  At how she lives without a flaw.<br>
  She floats in faith, through dusk and dawn—<br>
  I deeply admire her.<br>
  She is the swan.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles…”<br>
  — Isaiah 40:31</p>
  

  <p class="poem-line">So I pray—<br>
  Lord, let me never take her for granted,<br>
  Let me honor her heart, so candid.<br>
  And if I am to love her true,<br>
  Let it be with the love You give too.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">For she is the swan I prayed for,<br>
  And in her, I see Your love, once more.</p>

  <!-- Poem: The White Heart I Admire -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <img src="image\heart.png" alt="special img" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
  <h2 class="poem-title">The White Heart I Admire</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Have you seen a soul so soft, so still,<br>
  Like morning light upon a hill?<br>
  Not loud, not proud, not chasing fame,<br>
  Yet every step—He knows her name.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She walks not high, but walks with grace,<br>
  A holy hush upon her face.<br>
  She doesn’t boast, she doesn’t shine,<br>
  Yet somehow makes the heavens align.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Let your garments always be white, and let your head lack no oil.”<br>
  — Ecclesiastes 9:8</p>

  <p class="poem-line">How can her heart remain so pure,<br>
  In a world so fast, so unsure?<br>
  She doesn’t scream, she doesn’t fight,<br>
  Yet darkness bows before her light.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She is not perfect, yet she’s rare,<br>
  A breath of calm, a silent prayer.<br>
  She doesn't rule, yet she inspires—<br>
  A quiet spark that sets wild fires.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“You shall be blameless before the Lord your God.”<br>
  — Deuteronomy 18:13</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Have you heard the snow when it starts to fall?<br>
  How softly it covers, how it silences all?<br>
  That's how her presence enters the room—<br>
  Gentle as light, yet breaking the gloom.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She forgives before she’s asked,<br>
  Lays down her pride, removes the mask.<br>
  She doesn’t act to be admired—<br>
  But leaves you still, your soul rewired.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Who can say, ‘I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin’?”<br>
  — Proverbs 20:9</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She doesn’t wear a crown of gold,<br>
  But wears a truth that’s centuries old.<br>
  She clings to Christ, she walks His way,<br>
  And lets His mercy guide her day.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So tell me now, how could I not<br>
  Admire the soul the world forgot?<br>
  The one who walks in holy white,<br>
  Whose spirit sings in silent light?</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“The Lord knows those who are His, and let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”<br>
  — 2 Timothy 2:19</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She’s not just kind—she’s set apart,<br>
  With heaven etched upon her heart.<br>
  And though she never seeks the throne,<br>
  She leads by love, and not alone.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She is the white heart I revere—<br>
  So pure, so strong, so crystal clear.<br>
  And though her favorite color is white,<br>
  It’s her soul that truly shines that light.</p>

  <img src="image\cor.png" alt="special img" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
  <h2 class="poem-title">What Eyes Don’t See</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">How does she shine in a world so loud,<br>
  Where dreams dissolve and hope wears out?<br>
  While chaos carves through every street,<br>
  She walks in grace, with steady feet.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She isn’t moved by shifting sand,<br>
  Her heart is held in higher hands.<br>
  She walks by truth the world denies—<br>
  She sees through Heaven’s silent eyes.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I wonder, what’s her secret light?<br>
  What lifts her soul through darkest nights?<br>
  She holds a verse, not just in speech—<br>
  But in her bones, her soul, her reach.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">"No eye has seen," the verse begins,<br>
  "No ear has heard," where hope begins.<br>
  "No mind has known what God’s prepared<br>
  For those who love Him, those who dare."</p>

  <p class="poem-line">That’s her anthem, that’s her core—<br>
  When life is less, she trusts there’s more.<br>
  She lives like promise is already done,<br>
  Like storms just pass before the sun.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And in her quiet, I see strength—<br>
  Not in noise, but in the length<br>
  Of every trial she’s overcome,<br>
  With faith that speaks when words are none.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I’ve watched her love when love is rare,<br>
  Give when empty, stand in prayer.<br>
  Not chasing crowns the world can give,<br>
  But treasures found in how she lives.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And maybe that's what draws me near—<br>
  Not just her strength, but how she hears<br>
  A voice beyond what earth can show—<br>
  A faith in things I long to know.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">She is the verse she holds inside,<br>
  A living proof that God still guides.<br>
  And in a world that cannot see,<br>
  She walks with faith—and that moves me.</p>

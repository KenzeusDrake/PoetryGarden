    <h2 class="poem-title">When the Tomb Was Still Cold, but My Faith Was Already Alive</h2>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      I didn’t expect 2k25 to feel like this.<br>
      Not with lilies.<br>
      Not with light.<br>
      But with loss.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Two consecutive days of April—<br>
      my dad went home, my lolo followed.<br>
      Back-to-back grief.<br>
      Like Good Friday never ended.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      And yet, somehow…<br>
      My faith never wavered.<br>
      Not this time.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Because I remember when I used to doubt.<br>
      When my obasan passed away,<br>
      I didn’t just bury her—<br>
      I buried my faith with her.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      I let the silence convince me that God was absent.<br>
      I lived like someone forgotten,<br>
      Breathing, but barely believing.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Until someone came into my life—<br>
      Not with preaching, but presence.<br>
      Not with judgment, but gentleness.<br>
      They walked beside me,<br>
      And through them, God whispered:
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      “I never left you.”
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      And slowly, I came back.<br>
      Broken, but believing.<br>
      Wounded, but worshiping.<br>
      And now, I can say with every tear:<br>
      I trust You, Lord.<br>
      Not just in blessing—<br>
      But also in the breaking.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Today, I didn’t cling to flowers.<br>
      I clung to the Seven Last Words of Jesus.<br>
      And through each one, He brought me peace in my pain.
    </p>

    <h3 class="poem-section-title">1. “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” – Luke 23:34 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” — Luke 23:34 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      And I wept.<br>
      Because I was once the one who didn’t know.<br>
      Didn’t know how deeply He loved me.<br>
      Didn’t know how much I needed forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      But He forgave me before I asked.<br>
      And now, I live in that mercy.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” — Colossians 3:13 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">2. “Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.” – Luke 23:43 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” — Luke 23:43 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      And I held this tightly.<br>
      Because my dad—<br>
      My lolo—<br>
      They knew Jesus.<br>
      And Jesus promised today, not someday.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      So I don’t grieve like one without hope.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“My Father’s house has many rooms… I am going there to prepare a place for you… I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.” — John 14:2–3 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">3. “Woman, behold your son!” … “Behold your mother!” – John 19:26–27 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Woman, here is your son,” and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” — John 19:26–27 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Even in dying, Jesus formed family.<br>
      And now, I look at who’s left.<br>
      We are scarred—<br>
      But still standing.<br>
      And that means we carry each other now.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.” — Galatians 6:2 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">4. “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” – Matthew 27:46 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice… “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” — Matthew 27:46 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      I used to feel forsaken.<br>
      But now I know—<br>
      If Jesus cried those words,<br>
      Then even my darkest cries are still prayers.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” — Psalm 34:18 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“So do not fear, for I am with you… I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” — Isaiah 41:10 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">5. “I thirst!” – John 19:28 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” — John 19:28 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      I thirsted once.<br>
      For peace.<br>
      For purpose.<br>
      For someone to say it’ll be okay.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      But Jesus quenched my soul with Living Water.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” — John 4:14 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">6. “It is finished!” – John 19:30 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. — John 19:30 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      It didn’t feel finished when I lost them.<br>
      It felt like everything ended.<br>
      But Jesus didn’t say, “I am finished”—<br>
      He said, “It is.”<br>
      The battle. The curse. The grave.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.” — Romans 8:18 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section-title">7. “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.” – Luke 23:46 (NKJV)</h3>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last. — Luke 23:46 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      And now—so do I.<br>
      Not with fear,<br>
      But with faith.<br>
      Not because I understand the plan,<br>
      But because I trust the One who holds it.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.” — Psalm 46:1 (NIV)</em></p>
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” — Proverbs 3:5–6 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <hr>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      So here I am.<br>
      Still grieving.<br>
      But grounded.<br>
      Still weeping.<br>
      But worshiping.<br>
      Still missing them.<br>
      But never again missing God.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Because someone helped me find my way back.<br>
      And Jesus—Jesus met me in the ashes.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Now, I walk with faith that does not shake.<br>
      Now, I praise not just for blessings—<br>
      But even for brokenness.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      Because even in sorrow… He is risen.<br>
      Even in suffering… He is alive.<br>
      And so is my hope.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed;<br>
      Perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
      Persecuted, but not abandoned;<br>
      Struck down, but not destroyed.<br>
      We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in us.” — 2 Corinthians 4:8–10 (NIV)</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      So let it be revealed in me.<br>
      In every word.<br>
      Every tear.<br>
      Every testimony.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">
      I’m still here.<br>
      Because Jesus lives in me.

        <h2 class="poem-title">My Point of View: The Proof They Keep Ignoring</h2>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          I saw a comment while scrolling on my socmed, “How do you know God is real?” <br>
          And honestly, I could give them a hundred reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          But here’s what I really want to say— <br>
          This is what I believe. <br>
          This is what I see. <br>
          This is what makes sense to both my mind and my soul.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">The Universe Had a Beginning—And Beginnings Need a Beginner</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Science says the universe began 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang. <br>
          That event was the start of time, space, and matter. <br>
          But even physicist Stephen Hawking admitted: "The universe has not always existed. It had a beginning."
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          And what causes a beginning? <br>
          According to the Law of Causality, every effect has a cause. <br>
          Something can’t come from nothing. <br>
          And the First Law of Thermodynamics? Energy can’t create itself. It can only be transferred.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So how did something come from nothing? <br>
          Only an eternal, immaterial, powerful force could exist outside time, matter, and space.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Genesis 1:1 — “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">The Universe Was Fine-Tuned for Life</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Scientists call it the Anthropic Principle— <br>
          The idea that the universe appears deliberately designed for human life.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If gravity were slightly weaker, stars couldn’t form. <br>
          If it were stronger, stars would burn too fast. <br>
          If the Earth were just a little closer or farther from the sun, we’d freeze or burn. <br>
          Even the cosmological constant (which controls the expansion of the universe) is so precise, Stephen Weinberg said: <br>
          "Life as we know it would be impossible if it were off by one part in 10 to the 120th power."
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">That’s not random.</p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Isaiah 45:18 — “For this is what the Lord says—He who created the heavens… He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.”</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">DNA: The Language of God</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Each of our cells carries a DNA code with over 3 billion letters— <br>
          A biological instruction manual.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Francis Collins, the leader of the Human Genome Project and a Christian, said: <br>
          "DNA is the language of God."
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because code requires intelligence. <br>
          Letters require a writer. <br>
          Messages need a sender.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Psalm 139:13-14 — “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb… I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">That’s not poetry to me—it’s proof.</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Life Can’t Come from Non-Life</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          The theory of evolution may explain change over time— <br>
          but it doesn’t explain how life started.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          The Miller-Urey experiment tried to recreate early Earth conditions and “spark” life— <br>
          but it didn’t even come close to creating a living cell.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Even atheist scientists now admit: <br>
          "Abiogenesis (life from non-life) is still one of the biggest mysteries in biology."
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Genesis 2:7 — “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life…”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">Life comes from life— and the Author of life gave it.</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Consciousness, Morality, and Meaning—Where Did They Come From?</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We don’t just survive—we think, choose, create, worship. <br>
          But natural selection doesn’t need art, prayer, or sacrifice to survive. <br>
          So why do they exist?
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Why do we hunger for justice, cry at funerals, sing with passion, or question the afterlife?
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Ecclesiastes 3:11 — “He has also set eternity in the human heart…”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">That’s why nothing in this world fully satisfies— <br> Because I was made for more.</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Morality Isn’t Just a Human Idea—It’s a Divine Signature</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If there’s no God, then morality is a cultural invention. <br>
          But no culture praises cowardice. No tribe admires betrayal.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Romans 2:15 — “The requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We know some things are objectively wrong. <br>
          Not because we were taught— <br>
          But because we were designed that way.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Even Time Bows to the Eternal</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity showed that time is not absolute. <br>
          It’s tied to matter and energy. <br>
          So if the universe had a beginning, time itself had a beginning.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          That means the Cause of the universe must be timeless.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Revelation 1:8 — “I am the Alpha and the Omega… who is, and who was, and who is to come.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">He’s not bound by time. He holds it in His hands.</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Jesus: The Invisible Made Visible</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          People say, “Show me God, then I’ll believe.” <br>
          But He already did.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">John 1:14 — “The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Jesus healed the sick. He calmed storms. He raised the dead. He forgave sins. <br>
          And He didn’t just die—He walked out of His own grave.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Over 500 eyewitnesses saw Him after the resurrection. <br>
          And early disciples gave their lives for that truth— <br>
          Not for a myth. Not for power. <br>
          But because they saw the Living God.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">The Resurrection Changed History—And Me</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If Jesus didn’t rise from the dead, there is no Christianity. <br>
          But if He did— <br>
          Then everything He said is true. <br>
          And that changes everything.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">1 Corinthians 15:14 — “If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          But the evidence, both historical and spiritual, keeps pointing to one thing: <br>
          He is alive.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          And that’s why I believe not just in a God— <br>
          But in Jesus, the God who came close.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">In the End, I Don’t Just Believe in God—He’s the Reason I Breathe</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If there’s no God: <br>
          There’s no reason for beauty. <br>
          No foundation for truth. <br>
          No purpose in suffering. <br>
          No hope after death.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          But I believe:
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Acts 17:28 — “For in Him we live and move and have our being.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Every atom, every heartbeat, every moment— <br>
          it all points back to Him.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">So When They Ask Me: "Where’s the Proof?"</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I say: Look at the stars. Look at DNA. Look at the human heart. <br>
          Look at the empty tomb. Look at the longing in your soul.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          It all leads to one truth: <br>
          God is not just real—He is the reason for everything.
        </p>

      <h2 class="poem-title">Boundless Grace, Broken Chains</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by "O Come to the Altar")</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Are you tired? Tired of running, tired of hiding, tired of pretending you're okay? Does your soul feel heavy, like the weight of everything you've done is too much to carry?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Listen, there's a place where your burdens can rest, a place where the weight of your past doesn't define your future. It's not in your own strength, but in the open arms of grace.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">"O come to the altar," He calls, not with judgment, but with invitation—a Father's voice, asking you to come just as you are, broken and weary, and let His love make you whole.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The cross wasn't just a sacrifice—it was a declaration of freedom.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Nailed hands, open arms, saying, "Come, and lay down your chains." No matter the scars, no matter the shame—there is freedom in His name.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains. These aren't just words; they are a promise, a promise that your story doesn't end in defeat, but in redemption. Why wait?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Why carry the weight when He already carried it for you? Why live in fear when He has already overcome the grave?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The altar is open—not a place of condemnation, but a place of healing. Come—drop your pain, drop your doubt, and let grace rewrite your story.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains. The invitation is simple: Come to the altar, where love still bleeds for you, where you are made new, where your chains fall, and your soul is free.</p>

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">The Ache That Prayer Holds</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">I still can't sleep tonight.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">My eyes are wide, but my heart is tired. I keep staring at the ceiling, hoping it would give me answers—answers to a question I never wanted to ask: Why so soon? Why you? Why now?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Everything happened so fast. One moment, you were here—breathing, laughing, living. The next, you were a memory I wasn't ready to keep. A silence I never wanted to hear.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I still replay your voice in my mind, hold on to the echo of your laughter, as if remembering you could somehow bring you back. But it doesn't. And that truth crushes me over and over again.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">It doesn't feel real. Some days, I wait for a call that will never come. I hold back tears in crowded rooms, then weep alone when the world goes quiet.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Yet in this unbearable ache, I stand—shaking, grieving, questioning—but still standing. Because I believe in the God who never makes mistakes. Even when His ways feel like shattered glass beneath my feet.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I trust Him. Even when my heart screams in confusion. I believe, even when I don't understand. And I hold on, even when letting go feels impossible.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Because I know—one day, this pain will bloom into peace. And somehow, it will be well... not because I feel it now, but because He said so.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." —Revelation 21:4</p>

    <!-- Poem 3 -->
    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Faith That Lives Louder Than Words</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">Inspired by Titus</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Ever wonder why your faith still feels?<br>
      Like roots that thirst but never fill?<br>
      Could it be it's not just what you believe,<br>
      But the life you live, the grace you give?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">What if I told you, this letter—so brief,<br>
      From Paul to Titus, brings heart to belief?<br>
      A church with promise, but lost in the storm,<br>
      With chaos, false teaching, and no true form.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Enter Titus—not green, not unsure,<br>
      But steadfast and faithful, grounded and pure.<br>
      He didn't just teach, he became the way.<br>
      Living the truth in the light of day.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Paul didn't just send a scroll to recite,<br>
      He said, "Let them see shine with the light."<br>
      Because doctrine alone can't carry the weight<br>
      If your hands don't move and your love comes late.</p>
  
      <p class="bible-verse">"He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it." (Titus 1:9, NIV)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">That's kind of reliable. Not just vocal, but credible.<br>
      Visible. Viable.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">When I was younger, I thought faith was knowing.<br>
      That learning the Word meant I was growing.<br>
      But faith isn't built on verses alone—<br>
      It's seen in the quiet, when you're all on your own.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">It's kindness given with no one to praise,<br>
      It's showing up strong on the hardest of days.<br>
      It's grace that forgives when the hurt runs deep,<br>
      It's promises made that your soul will keep.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's be honest—faith that speaks but doesn't act,<br>
      Feels hollow, like words that truth has lacked.<br>
      You can preach all you want, raise your voice to the sky.<br>
      But if your life lies silent, people pass it by.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Titus reminds us: grace is not still,<br>
      It's a fire that shapes both heart and will.<br>
      So don't cling to the past with a "that was me" line—<br>
      Because grace transforms—leaves the old behind.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">So here's the question, loud and clear:<br>
      When they look at your life, what do they hear?<br>
      Do they see real faith, humble and true?<br>
      Or just another routine the church folk do?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's not just talk—let's let it out,<br>
      Live the faith we preach, remove all doubt.<br>
      For faith that shows is the faith that stays,<br>
      And shines like light in the darkest of days.</p>

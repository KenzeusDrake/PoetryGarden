      <h2 class="poem-title">Boundless Grace, Broken Chains</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by "O Come to the Altar")</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Are you tired? Tired of running,<br>
      Tired of hiding, tired of pretending you're okay?<br>
      Does your soul feel heavy,<br>
      Like the weight of everything you've done is too much to carry?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Listen, there's a place where your burdens can rest,<br>
      A place where the weight of your past doesn't define your future.<br>
      It's not in your own strength,<br>
      But in the open arms of grace.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">"O come to the altar," He calls,<br>
      Not with judgment, but with invitation—<br>
      A Father's voice, asking you to come just as you are,<br>
      Broken and weary, and let His love make you whole.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The cross wasn't just a sacrifice—<br>
      It was a declaration of freedom.<br>
      Nailed hands, open arms, saying,<br>
      "Come, and lay down your chains."</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">No matter the scars,<br>
      No matter the shame—<br>
      There is freedom in His name.<br>
      Boundless grace. Broken chains.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">These aren't just words; they are a promise—<br>
      A promise that your story doesn't end in defeat,<br>
      But in redemption.<br>
      Why wait?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Why carry the weight<br>
      When He already carried it for you?<br>
      Why live in fear<br>
      When He has already overcome the grave?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The altar is open—<br>
      Not a place of condemnation,<br>
      But a place of healing.<br>
      Come—drop your pain, drop your doubt, and let grace rewrite your story.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains.<br>
      The invitation is simple:<br>
      Come to the altar,<br>
      Where love still bleeds for you, where you are made new,<br>
      Where your chains fall, and your soul is free.</p>

    <!-- Poem: The Ache That Prayer Holds -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Ache That Prayer Holds</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I still can't sleep tonight.<br>
  My eyes are wide, but my heart is tired.<br>
  I keep staring at the ceiling,<br>
  Hoping it would give me answers—answers to a question I never wanted to ask:</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Why so soon? Why you? Why now?<br>
  Everything happened so fast.<br>
  One moment, you were here—breathing, laughing, living.<br>
  The next, you were a memory I wasn't ready to keep.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">A silence I never wanted to hear.<br>
  I still replay your voice in my mind,<br>
  Hold on to the echo of your laughter,<br>
  As if remembering you could somehow bring you back.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But it doesn't. And that truth crushes me<br>
  Over and over again.<br>
  It doesn't feel real. Some days, I wait<br>
  For a call that will never come.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I hold back tears in crowded rooms,<br>
  Then weep alone when the world goes quiet.<br>
  Yet in this unbearable ache, I stand—<br>
  Shaking, grieving, questioning—but still standing.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Because I believe in the God who never makes mistakes,<br>
  Even when His ways feel like shattered glass beneath my feet.<br>
  I trust Him, even when my heart screams in confusion.<br>
  I believe, even when I don't understand.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I hold on, even when letting go feels impossible.<br>
  Because I know—one day, this pain will bloom into peace.<br>
  And somehow, it will be well...<br>
  Not because I feel it now, but because He said so.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."<br>
  — Revelation 21:4</p>

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Faith That Lives Louder Than Words</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Titus)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Ever wonder why your faith still feels?<br>
      Like roots that thirst but never fill?<br>
      Could it be it's not just what you believe,<br>
      But the life you live, the grace you give?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">What if I told you, this letter—so brief,<br>
      From Paul to Titus, brings heart to belief?<br>
      A church with promise, but lost in the storm,<br>
      With chaos, false teaching, and no true form.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Enter Titus—not green, not unsure,<br>
      But steadfast and faithful, grounded and pure.<br>
      He didn't just teach, he became the way.<br>
      Living the truth in the light of day.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Paul didn't just send a scroll to recite,<br>
      He said, "Let them see shine with the light."<br>
      Because doctrine alone can't carry the weight<br>
      If your hands don't move and your love comes late.</p>
  
      <p class="bible-verse">"He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it." (Titus 1:9, NIV)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">That's kind of reliable. Not just vocal, but credible.<br>
      Visible. Viable.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">When I was younger, I thought faith was knowing.<br>
      That learning the Word meant I was growing.<br>
      But faith isn't built on verses alone—<br>
      It's seen in the quiet, when you're all on your own.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">It's kindness given with no one to praise,<br>
      It's showing up strong on the hardest of days.<br>
      It's grace that forgives when the hurt runs deep,<br>
      It's promises made that your soul will keep.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's be honest—faith that speaks but doesn't act,<br>
      Feels hollow, like words that truth has lacked.<br>
      You can preach all you want, raise your voice to the sky.<br>
      But if your life lies silent, people pass it by.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Titus reminds us: grace is not still,<br>
      It's a fire that shapes both heart and will.<br>
      So don't cling to the past with a "that was me" line—<br>
      Because grace transforms—leaves the old behind.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">So here's the question, loud and clear:<br>
      When they look at your life, what do they hear?<br>
      Do they see real faith, humble and true?<br>
      Or just another routine the church folk do?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's not just talk—let's let it out,<br>
      Live the faith we preach, remove all doubt.<br>
      For faith that shows is the faith that stays,<br>
      And shines like light in the darkest of days.</p>

<!-- Poem: When Favor Finds You -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">When Favor Finds You</h2>
  <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Esther 4:14, Romans 8:28, and Proverbs 3:5–6)</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I didn’t plan this path I tread,<br>
  Nor dreamed these doors where I’d be led.<br>
  I lived a life so still, unseen,<br>
  Content in quiet — calm and clean.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then He moved—without a sound,<br>
  And favor found me, holy ground.<br>
  No signs, no maps, no curtain drawn,<br>
  Just grace that led my feet at dawn.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
  and lean not on your own insight.<br>
  In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br>
  and He will make your pathways right.”<br>
  — Proverbs 3:5–6</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At first, I thought, “Oh, this is mine!”<br>
  A gift of heaven’s grand design.<br>
  But time revealed a deeper view:<br>
  This blessing wasn’t just for you.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It flowed to me, but not to stay,<br>
  It’s meant to shape, to light the way.<br>
  Like Esther crowned, yet not for show,<br>
  She rose so others too might grow.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And who knows but that you have come<br>
  to royal place for such a time?”<br>
  — Esther 4:14, its silent drum<br>
  Now beats within this heart of mine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It wasn’t skill that brought me near,<br>
  Nor strength that overcame my fear.<br>
  It was obedience, clothed in grace,<br>
  A trembling “yes” in hidden place.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Through silent prayers and waiting still,<br>
  Through letting go of lesser will,<br>
  I found that favor does not chase<br>
  The proud, but meets the lowly place.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And we know that in all things God<br>
  Works for the good, both wide and broad,<br>
  For those who love Him, walk His way—<br>
  He weaves the night into the day.”<br>
  — Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So if you’re standing where I stood,<br>
  Unsure if this is bad or good,<br>
  Remember this: God sees it all—<br>
  He writes His glory through your call.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s not just to you blessings flow,<br>
  But through you, others come to know<br>
  That favor's not for pride or show—<br>
  It’s how His love and truth will grow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So take the step, though small, unsure,<br>
  Your trembling faith, He will secure.<br>
  And when you stand in heaven’s view,<br>
  You’ll see — God’s favor carried through.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Rubik’s Cube of Life</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Life is like a Rubik’s Cube—<br>
  Twisted, turned, and sometimes crude.<br>
  The colors spin, the sides collide,<br>
  Each move I make, a step I slide.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven."<br>
  —Ecclesiastes 3:1</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At times, it feels like all is lost,<br>
  A tangled mess, no matter the cost.<br>
  I twist and turn, but nothing fits,<br>
  A puzzle broken into bits.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But in the chaos, I find a truth—<br>
  Even the mess has its own proof.<br>
  Each turn, each twist, each move I make,<br>
  Shapes the path that I must take.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."<br>
  —Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Some pieces don't align just right,<br>
  But with patience, I see the light.<br>
  Through every wrong, a lesson learned,<br>
  In every loss, there’s something earned.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."<br>
  —Romans 5:3-4</p>

  <p class="poem-line">The cube of life may twist again,<br>
  But through the struggle, I find my zen.<br>
  For though it's hard to see the way,<br>
  In time, the pieces will obey.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands."<br>
  —Psalm 138:8</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s never perfect, this game I play,<br>
  But I find the pieces day by day.<br>
  Life may be a Rubik’s Cube, a test,<br>
  But I’ll fix myself—putting my soul to rest.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength."<br>
  —Philippians 4:13</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Each twist, each turn, a chance to grow,<br>
  To heal, to change, to let love flow.<br>
  For in this cube, I see the grace—<br>
  That even in chaos, I find my place.</p>

  <h2 class="poem-title">No Turning Back: Manatiling Liwanag sa Dilim</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was lost, a soul adrift,<br>
  Caught in the wind, no steady lift.<br>
  I walked in doubt, I walked in fear,<br>
  My faith was small, my heart unclear.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I searched for answers on my own,<br>
  Through paths of pain, through seeds once sown.<br>
  But all I found were broken dreams,<br>
  A heart that cracked and lost its seams.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then, a light broke through the dark,<br>
  A whisper called, igniting spark.<br>
  A hand that reached, a voice so kind,<br>
  Guided my heart, redefined.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">From unbelief, I learned to stand,<br>
  A life once lost, now in His hand.<br>
  The roots of faith began to grow,<br>
  And I was not the one to sow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">For now, my faith is like a tree,<br>
  Planted firm in what I can't see.<br>
  Its roots run deep beneath the ground,<br>
  In the Lord’s love, I’ve found my sound.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No more a soul tossed by the storm,<br>
  For now I stand, my heart reborn.<br>
  Faith like a mountain, strong and tall,<br>
  I will not crumble, I will not fall.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I trust the path, I trust the way,<br>
  No matter what the world may say.<br>
  For His plans are greater than mine,<br>
  I walk by faith, His will divine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was weak, but now I’m strong,<br>
  In Him, I find where I belong.<br>
  Faith is my fortress, faith is my song,<br>
  And with His grace, I will go long.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No turning back, no second guess,<br>
  For my faith now is firm, no less.<br>
  It’s anchored deep, it’s built to last,<br>
  Rooted in truth, unshaken fast.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I stand today, I rise again,<br>
  In every storm, through every pain.<br>
  My faith is stronger, I won’t sway—<br>
  For with Proverbs 3:5-6, I’ll find my way.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">More Doesn’t Always Mean Worth</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">It was Easter Sunday.<br>
  My little sister looked up at me with bright eyes.<br>
  “Kuya, can we do the egg hunt? Just like before… with obasan?”<br>
  Her words brought me back to days filled with obasan’s laughter,<br>
  when joy echoed through the house like music.<br>
  I smiled.<br>
  “Ay yah, tara. Game.”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Together, we prepared the eggs—16 in total:<br>
  5 eggs with ₱500<br>
  5 eggs with ₱100<br>
  5 eggs with ₱200<br>
  1 special egg with ₱1,000</p>

  <p class="poem-line">We carefully tucked them away—<br>
  behind flower pots, under benches, inside slippers, beneath leaves—<br>
  laughing as we tried to be sneaky.<br>
  The kids waited eagerly inside the house, peeking through windows.<br>
  When the last egg was hidden, I shouted, “Okay, ready na!”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And off they ran.<br><br>
  Kenji, 8, found 3 eggs.<br>
  Alyssa, clever and quick, found 4.<br>
  Jomar, 17, snatched 7.<br>
  Two cousins found the last 2.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">After the search, they gathered, out of breath but grinning.<br>
  “Kuya, ang dami mong nakuha! Sana all!” Alyssa teased.<br>
  Jomar laughed, “Mabilis kasi ako maghanap!”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But when we opened the eggs, the results surprised everyone.<br><br>
  Kenji, with 3 eggs, had ₱1,700<br>
  Alyssa, with 4 eggs, also had ₱1,700<br>
  Jomar, with 7 eggs, had ₱1,300<br>
  The cousins got ₱100 and ₱200</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jomar stared, confused.<br>
  He thought he’d won because he had the most.<br>
  But it wasn’t about how many—<br>
  it was about what was inside.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I smiled and shared the lesson:<br>
  “Sa buhay, hindi palaging mas marami ang may pinakamataas na halaga.<br>
  Sometimes, the ones with the most don’t always have the most value.<br>
  It’s not about how much you have,<br>
  but about the heart behind it.”</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Widow’s Offering</strong> <em>(Mark 12:41–44)</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jesus was sitting near the temple treasury, watching people give their offerings.<br>
  The rich gave large sums, but a poor widow came forward,<br>
  giving only two small coins—less than a penny.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jesus said to His disciples:<br>
  <em>“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">Her offering wasn’t large,<br>
  but it was great in heart.<br>
  She gave all she had,<br>
  and in God’s eyes, that was more valuable than the rich gifts of many others.</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>David’s Anointing</strong> <em>(1 Samuel 16:7)</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">When Samuel went to anoint the next king,<br>
  he saw Jesse’s sons—strong, tall, and impressive.<br>
  But God spoke to him and said:</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><em>“Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">God chose David, the youngest, a shepherd—<br>
  the one no one thought of.<br>
  God saw his heart, his faithfulness, and his love for God.<br>
  Outward appearances don’t matter to God; it’s the heart that counts.</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Lesson:</strong><br><br>
  In life, it’s not about how much we have,<br>
  but what we carry inside.<br>
  Not the size of our offering, but the spirit in which we give it.<br>
  Not how we appear, but who we are at the core.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Just like the egg hunt:<br>
  Those with fewer eggs received more in value.<br>
  It’s not always about quantity.<br>
  It’s about quality. Intent. Love.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And those two cousins—<br>
  they didn’t get the biggest prizes,<br>
  but they smiled just the same.<br>
  They weren’t chasing the money.<br>
  They were chasing the moment.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I whispered, “I remember of Obasan…”<br>
  I held the eggs, not for the cash inside,<br>
  but for the memory wrapped in plastic shells.<br>
  The joy of the search.<br>
  The laughter of family.<br>
  The feeling of being together.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Sometimes, the greatest prize isn't in the egg—<br>
  but in the moment you shared looking for it.</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong><em>Mark 10:31 (NIV):</em></strong><br>
  <em>“But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">In God’s eyes,<br>
  those who seem to have the least<br>
  often hold the richest treasures.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So, in the end,<br>
  it’s not about how many eggs you find,<br>
  or how much you gain.<br>
  It’s about what you do with what you have,<br>
  and whether you offer it with a heart that loves, remembers, and trusts in God.</p>

    I didn’t expect 2k25 to feel like this.<br>
    Not with lilies.<br>
    Not with light.<br>
    But with loss.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Two consecutive days of April—<br>
    my dad went home, my lolo followed.<br>
    Back-to-back grief.<br>
    Like Good Friday never ended.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    And yet, somehow…<br>
    My faith never wavered.<br>
    Not this time.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Because I remember when I used to doubt.<br>
    When my obasan passed away,<br>
    I didn’t just bury her—<br>
    I buried my faith with her.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    I let the silence convince me that God was absent.<br>
    I lived like someone forgotten,<br>
    Breathing, but barely believing.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Until someone came into my life—<br>
    Not with preaching, but presence.<br>
    Not with judgment, but gentleness.<br>
    They walked beside me,<br>
    And through them, God whispered:
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    “I never left you.”
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    And slowly, I came back.<br>
    Broken, but believing.<br>
    Wounded, but worshiping.<br>
    And now, I can say with every tear:<br>
    I trust You, Lord.<br>
    Not just in blessing—<br>
    But also in the breaking.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Today, I didn’t cling to flowers.<br>
    I clung to the Seven Last Words of Jesus.<br>
    And through each one, He brought me peace in my pain.

  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” — Luke 23:34 (NIV)</em></p>
  <p class="poem-line">
    And I wept.<br>
    Because I was once the one who didn’t know.<br>
    Didn’t know how deeply He loved me.<br>
    Didn’t know how much I needed forgiveness.
  </p>
  <p class="poem-line">
    But He forgave me before I asked.<br>
    And now, I live in that mercy.
  </p>
  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” — Colossians 3:13 (NIV)</em></p>

  <h3 class="poem-section-title">2. “Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.” – Luke 23:43 (NKJV)</h3>
  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” — Luke 23:43 (NIV)</em></p>
  <p class="poem-line">
    And I held this tightly.<br>
    Because my dad—<br>
    My lolo—<br>
    They knew Jesus.<br>
    And Jesus promised today, not someday.
  </p>
  <p class="poem-line">
    So I don’t grieve like one without hope.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Even in dying, Jesus formed family.<br>
    And now, I look at who’s left.<br>
    We are scarred—<br>
    But still standing.<br>
    And that means we carry each other now.

  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice… “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” — Matthew 27:46 (NIV)</em></p>

    I used to feel forsaken.<br>
    But now I know—<br>

    Then even my darkest cries are still prayers.

  <p class="poem-line">
    I thirsted once.<br>
    For peace.<br>
    For purpose.<br>
    For someone to say it’ll be okay.
  </p>
  <p class="poem-line">
    But Jesus quenched my soul with Living Water.

  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” — John 4:14 (NIV)</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    It didn’t feel finished when I lost them.<br>
    It felt like everything ended.<br>
    But Jesus didn’t say, “I am finished”—<br>
    He said, “It is.”<br>
    The battle. The curse. The grave.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    And now—so do I.<br>
    Not with fear,<br>
    But with faith.<br>
    Not because I understand the plan,<br>
    But because I trust the One who holds it.

  <p class="poem-line">
    So here I am.<br>
    Still grieving.<br>
    But grounded.<br>
    Still weeping.<br>
    But worshiping.<br>
    Still missing them.<br>
    But never again missing God.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Because someone helped me find my way back.<br>
    And Jesus—Jesus met me in the ashes.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Now, I walk with faith that does not shake.<br>
    Now, I praise not just for blessings—<br>
    But even for brokenness.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    Because even in sorrow… He is risen.<br>
    Even in suffering… He is alive.<br>
    And so is my hope.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-scripture"><em>“We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed;<br>
    Perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
    Persecuted, but not abandoned;<br>

  <p class="poem-line">
    So let it be revealed in me.<br>
    In every word.<br>
    Every tear.<br>
    Every testimony.
  </p>

  <p class="poem-line">
    I’m still here.<br>
    Because Jesus lives in me.

      <h2 class="poem-title">Boundless Grace, Broken Chains</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by "O Come to the Altar")</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Are you tired? Tired of running,<br>
      Tired of hiding, tired of pretending you're okay?<br>
      Does your soul feel heavy,<br>
      Like the weight of everything you've done is too much to carry?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Listen, there's a place where your burdens can rest,<br>
      A place where the weight of your past doesn't define your future.<br>
      It's not in your own strength,<br>
      But in the open arms of grace.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">"O come to the altar," He calls,<br>
      Not with judgment, but with invitation—<br>
      A Father's voice, asking you to come just as you are,<br>
      Broken and weary, and let His love make you whole.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The cross wasn't just a sacrifice—<br>
      It was a declaration of freedom.<br>
      Nailed hands, open arms, saying,<br>
      "Come, and lay down your chains."</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">No matter the scars,<br>
      No matter the shame—<br>
      There is freedom in His name.<br>
      Boundless grace. Broken chains.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">These aren't just words; they are a promise—<br>
      A promise that your story doesn't end in defeat,<br>
      But in redemption.<br>
      Why wait?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Why carry the weight<br>
      When He already carried it for you?<br>
      Why live in fear<br>
      When He has already overcome the grave?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The altar is open—<br>
      Not a place of condemnation,<br>
      But a place of healing.<br>
      Come—drop your pain, drop your doubt, and let grace rewrite your story.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains.<br>
      The invitation is simple:<br>
      Come to the altar,<br>
      Where love still bleeds for you, where you are made new,<br>
      Where your chains fall, and your soul is free.</p>

    <!-- Poem: The Ache That Prayer Holds -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Ache That Prayer Holds</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I still can't sleep tonight.<br>
  My eyes are wide, but my heart is tired.<br>
  I keep staring at the ceiling,<br>
  Hoping it would give me answers—answers to a question I never wanted to ask:</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Why so soon? Why you? Why now?<br>
  Everything happened so fast.<br>
  One moment, you were here—breathing, laughing, living.<br>
  The next, you were a memory I wasn't ready to keep.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">A silence I never wanted to hear.<br>
  I still replay your voice in my mind,<br>
  Hold on to the echo of your laughter,<br>
  As if remembering you could somehow bring you back.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But it doesn't. And that truth crushes me<br>
  Over and over again.<br>
  It doesn't feel real. Some days, I wait<br>
  For a call that will never come.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I hold back tears in crowded rooms,<br>
  Then weep alone when the world goes quiet.<br>
  Yet in this unbearable ache, I stand—<br>
  Shaking, grieving, questioning—but still standing.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Because I believe in the God who never makes mistakes,<br>
  Even when His ways feel like shattered glass beneath my feet.<br>
  I trust Him, even when my heart screams in confusion.<br>
  I believe, even when I don't understand.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I hold on, even when letting go feels impossible.<br>
  Because I know—one day, this pain will bloom into peace.<br>
  And somehow, it will be well...<br>
  Not because I feel it now, but because He said so.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."<br>
  — Revelation 21:4</p>

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Faith That Lives Louder Than Words</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Titus)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Ever wonder why your faith still feels?<br>
      Like roots that thirst but never fill?<br>
      Could it be it's not just what you believe,<br>
      But the life you live, the grace you give?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">What if I told you, this letter—so brief,<br>
      From Paul to Titus, brings heart to belief?<br>
      A church with promise, but lost in the storm,<br>
      With chaos, false teaching, and no true form.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Enter Titus—not green, not unsure,<br>
      But steadfast and faithful, grounded and pure.<br>
      He didn't just teach, he became the way.<br>
      Living the truth in the light of day.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Paul didn't just send a scroll to recite,<br>
      He said, "Let them see shine with the light."<br>
      Because doctrine alone can't carry the weight<br>
      If your hands don't move and your love comes late.</p>
  
      <p class="bible-verse">"He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it." (Titus 1:9, NIV)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">That's kind of reliable. Not just vocal, but credible.<br>
      Visible. Viable.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">When I was younger, I thought faith was knowing.<br>
      That learning the Word meant I was growing.<br>
      But faith isn't built on verses alone—<br>
      It's seen in the quiet, when you're all on your own.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">It's kindness given with no one to praise,<br>
      It's showing up strong on the hardest of days.<br>
      It's grace that forgives when the hurt runs deep,<br>
      It's promises made that your soul will keep.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's be honest—faith that speaks but doesn't act,<br>
      Feels hollow, like words that truth has lacked.<br>
      You can preach all you want, raise your voice to the sky.<br>
      But if your life lies silent, people pass it by.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Titus reminds us: grace is not still,<br>
      It's a fire that shapes both heart and will.<br>
      So don't cling to the past with a "that was me" line—<br>
      Because grace transforms—leaves the old behind.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">So here's the question, loud and clear:<br>
      When they look at your life, what do they hear?<br>
      Do they see real faith, humble and true?<br>
      Or just another routine the church folk do?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's not just talk—let's let it out,<br>
      Live the faith we preach, remove all doubt.<br>
      For faith that shows is the faith that stays,<br>
      And shines like light in the darkest of days.</p>

<!-- Poem: When Favor Finds You -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">When Favor Finds You</h2>
  <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Esther 4:14, Romans 8:28, and Proverbs 3:5–6)</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I didn’t plan this path I tread,<br>
  Nor dreamed these doors where I’d be led.<br>
  I lived a life so still, unseen,<br>
  Content in quiet — calm and clean.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then He moved—without a sound,<br>
  And favor found me, holy ground.<br>
  No signs, no maps, no curtain drawn,<br>
  Just grace that led my feet at dawn.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
  and lean not on your own insight.<br>
  In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br>
  and He will make your pathways right.”<br>
  — Proverbs 3:5–6</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At first, I thought, “Oh, this is mine!”<br>
  A gift of heaven’s grand design.<br>
  But time revealed a deeper view:<br>
  This blessing wasn’t just for you.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It flowed to me, but not to stay,<br>
  It’s meant to shape, to light the way.<br>
  Like Esther crowned, yet not for show,<br>
  She rose so others too might grow.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And who knows but that you have come<br>
  to royal place for such a time?”<br>
  — Esther 4:14, its silent drum<br>
  Now beats within this heart of mine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It wasn’t skill that brought me near,<br>
  Nor strength that overcame my fear.<br>
  It was obedience, clothed in grace,<br>
  A trembling “yes” in hidden place.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Through silent prayers and waiting still,<br>
  Through letting go of lesser will,<br>
  I found that favor does not chase<br>
  The proud, but meets the lowly place.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And we know that in all things God<br>
  Works for the good, both wide and broad,<br>
  For those who love Him, walk His way—<br>
  He weaves the night into the day.”<br>
  — Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So if you’re standing where I stood,<br>
  Unsure if this is bad or good,<br>
  Remember this: God sees it all—<br>
  He writes His glory through your call.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s not just to you blessings flow,<br>
  But through you, others come to know<br>
  That favor's not for pride or show—<br>
  It’s how His love and truth will grow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So take the step, though small, unsure,<br>
  Your trembling faith, He will secure.<br>
  And when you stand in heaven’s view,<br>
  You’ll see — God’s favor carried through.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Rubik’s Cube of Life</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Life is like a Rubik’s Cube—<br>
  Twisted, turned, and sometimes crude.<br>
  The colors spin, the sides collide,<br>
  Each move I make, a step I slide.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven."<br>
  —Ecclesiastes 3:1</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At times, it feels like all is lost,<br>
  A tangled mess, no matter the cost.<br>
  I twist and turn, but nothing fits,<br>
  A puzzle broken into bits.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But in the chaos, I find a truth—<br>
  Even the mess has its own proof.<br>
  Each turn, each twist, each move I make,<br>
  Shapes the path that I must take.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."<br>
  —Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Some pieces don't align just right,<br>
  But with patience, I see the light.<br>
  Through every wrong, a lesson learned,<br>
  In every loss, there’s something earned.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."<br>
  —Romans 5:3-4</p>

  <p class="poem-line">The cube of life may twist again,<br>
  But through the struggle, I find my zen.<br>
  For though it's hard to see the way,<br>
  In time, the pieces will obey.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands."<br>
  —Psalm 138:8</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s never perfect, this game I play,<br>
  But I find the pieces day by day.<br>
  Life may be a Rubik’s Cube, a test,<br>
  But I’ll fix myself—putting my soul to rest.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength."<br>
  —Philippians 4:13</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Each twist, each turn, a chance to grow,<br>
  To heal, to change, to let love flow.<br>
  For in this cube, I see the grace—<br>
  That even in chaos, I find my place.</p>

  <h2 class="poem-title">No Turning Back: Manatiling Liwanag sa Dilim</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was lost, a soul adrift,<br>
  Caught in the wind, no steady lift.<br>
  I walked in doubt, I walked in fear,<br>
  My faith was small, my heart unclear.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I searched for answers on my own,<br>
  Through paths of pain, through seeds once sown.<br>
  But all I found were broken dreams,<br>
  A heart that cracked and lost its seams.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then, a light broke through the dark,<br>
  A whisper called, igniting spark.<br>
  A hand that reached, a voice so kind,<br>
  Guided my heart, redefined.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">From unbelief, I learned to stand,<br>
  A life once lost, now in His hand.<br>
  The roots of faith began to grow,<br>
  And I was not the one to sow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">For now, my faith is like a tree,<br>
  Planted firm in what I can't see.<br>
  Its roots run deep beneath the ground,<br>
  In the Lord’s love, I’ve found my sound.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No more a soul tossed by the storm,<br>
  For now I stand, my heart reborn.<br>
  Faith like a mountain, strong and tall,<br>
  I will not crumble, I will not fall.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I trust the path, I trust the way,<br>
  No matter what the world may say.<br>
  For His plans are greater than mine,<br>
  I walk by faith, His will divine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was weak, but now I’m strong,<br>
  In Him, I find where I belong.<br>
  Faith is my fortress, faith is my song,<br>
  And with His grace, I will go long.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No turning back, no second guess,<br>
  For my faith now is firm, no less.<br>
  It’s anchored deep, it’s built to last,<br>
  Rooted in truth, unshaken fast.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I stand today, I rise again,<br>
  In every storm, through every pain.<br>
  My faith is stronger, I won’t sway—<br>
  For with Proverbs 3:5-6, I’ll find my way.</p>

      <h2 class="poem-title">Boundless Grace, Broken Chains</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by "O Come to the Altar")</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Are you tired? Tired of running,<br>
      Tired of hiding, tired of pretending you're okay?<br>
      Does your soul feel heavy,<br>
      Like the weight of everything you've done is too much to carry?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Listen, there's a place where your burdens can rest,<br>
      A place where the weight of your past doesn't define your future.<br>
      It's not in your own strength,<br>
      But in the open arms of grace.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">"O come to the altar," He calls,<br>
      Not with judgment, but with invitation—<br>
      A Father's voice, asking you to come just as you are,<br>
      Broken and weary, and let His love make you whole.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The cross wasn't just a sacrifice—<br>
      It was a declaration of freedom.<br>
      Nailed hands, open arms, saying,<br>
      "Come, and lay down your chains."</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">No matter the scars,<br>
      No matter the shame—<br>
      There is freedom in His name.<br>
      Boundless grace. Broken chains.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">These aren't just words; they are a promise—<br>
      A promise that your story doesn't end in defeat,<br>
      But in redemption.<br>
      Why wait?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Why carry the weight<br>
      When He already carried it for you?<br>
      Why live in fear<br>
      When He has already overcome the grave?</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">The altar is open—<br>
      Not a place of condemnation,<br>
      But a place of healing.<br>
      Come—drop your pain, drop your doubt, and let grace rewrite your story.</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains.<br>
      The invitation is simple:<br>
      Come to the altar,<br>
      Where love still bleeds for you, where you are made new,<br>
      Where your chains fall, and your soul is free.</p>

    <!-- Poem: The Ache That Prayer Holds -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Ache That Prayer Holds</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I still can't sleep tonight.<br>
  My eyes are wide, but my heart is tired.<br>
  I keep staring at the ceiling,<br>
  Hoping it would give me answers—answers to a question I never wanted to ask:</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Why so soon? Why you? Why now?<br>
  Everything happened so fast.<br>
  One moment, you were here—breathing, laughing, living.<br>
  The next, you were a memory I wasn't ready to keep.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">A silence I never wanted to hear.<br>
  I still replay your voice in my mind,<br>
  Hold on to the echo of your laughter,<br>
  As if remembering you could somehow bring you back.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But it doesn't. And that truth crushes me<br>
  Over and over again.<br>
  It doesn't feel real. Some days, I wait<br>
  For a call that will never come.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I hold back tears in crowded rooms,<br>
  Then weep alone when the world goes quiet.<br>
  Yet in this unbearable ache, I stand—<br>
  Shaking, grieving, questioning—but still standing.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Because I believe in the God who never makes mistakes,<br>
  Even when His ways feel like shattered glass beneath my feet.<br>
  I trust Him, even when my heart screams in confusion.<br>
  I believe, even when I don't understand.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I hold on, even when letting go feels impossible.<br>
  Because I know—one day, this pain will bloom into peace.<br>
  And somehow, it will be well...<br>
  Not because I feel it now, but because He said so.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."<br>
  — Revelation 21:4</p>

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Faith That Lives Louder Than Words</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Titus)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Ever wonder why your faith still feels?<br>
      Like roots that thirst but never fill?<br>
      Could it be it's not just what you believe,<br>
      But the life you live, the grace you give?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">What if I told you, this letter—so brief,<br>
      From Paul to Titus, brings heart to belief?<br>
      A church with promise, but lost in the storm,<br>
      With chaos, false teaching, and no true form.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Enter Titus—not green, not unsure,<br>
      But steadfast and faithful, grounded and pure.<br>
      He didn't just teach, he became the way.<br>
      Living the truth in the light of day.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Paul didn't just send a scroll to recite,<br>
      He said, "Let them see shine with the light."<br>
      Because doctrine alone can't carry the weight<br>
      If your hands don't move and your love comes late.</p>
  
      <p class="bible-verse">"He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it." (Titus 1:9, NIV)</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">That's kind of reliable. Not just vocal, but credible.<br>
      Visible. Viable.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">When I was younger, I thought faith was knowing.<br>
      That learning the Word meant I was growing.<br>
      But faith isn't built on verses alone—<br>
      It's seen in the quiet, when you're all on your own.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">It's kindness given with no one to praise,<br>
      It's showing up strong on the hardest of days.<br>
      It's grace that forgives when the hurt runs deep,<br>
      It's promises made that your soul will keep.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's be honest—faith that speaks but doesn't act,<br>
      Feels hollow, like words that truth has lacked.<br>
      You can preach all you want, raise your voice to the sky.<br>
      But if your life lies silent, people pass it by.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Titus reminds us: grace is not still,<br>
      It's a fire that shapes both heart and will.<br>
      So don't cling to the past with a "that was me" line—<br>
      Because grace transforms—leaves the old behind.</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">So here's the question, loud and clear:<br>
      When they look at your life, what do they hear?<br>
      Do they see real faith, humble and true?<br>
      Or just another routine the church folk do?</p>
  
      <p class="poem-line">Let's not just talk—let's let it out,<br>
      Live the faith we preach, remove all doubt.<br>
      For faith that shows is the faith that stays,<br>
      And shines like light in the darkest of days.</p>

<!-- Poem: When Favor Finds You -->
<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">When Favor Finds You</h2>
  <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Esther 4:14, Romans 8:28, and Proverbs 3:5–6)</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I didn’t plan this path I tread,<br>
  Nor dreamed these doors where I’d be led.<br>
  I lived a life so still, unseen,<br>
  Content in quiet — calm and clean.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then He moved—without a sound,<br>
  And favor found me, holy ground.<br>
  No signs, no maps, no curtain drawn,<br>
  Just grace that led my feet at dawn.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
  and lean not on your own insight.<br>
  In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br>
  and He will make your pathways right.”<br>
  — Proverbs 3:5–6</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At first, I thought, “Oh, this is mine!”<br>
  A gift of heaven’s grand design.<br>
  But time revealed a deeper view:<br>
  This blessing wasn’t just for you.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It flowed to me, but not to stay,<br>
  It’s meant to shape, to light the way.<br>
  Like Esther crowned, yet not for show,<br>
  She rose so others too might grow.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And who knows but that you have come<br>
  to royal place for such a time?”<br>
  — Esther 4:14, its silent drum<br>
  Now beats within this heart of mine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It wasn’t skill that brought me near,<br>
  Nor strength that overcame my fear.<br>
  It was obedience, clothed in grace,<br>
  A trembling “yes” in hidden place.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Through silent prayers and waiting still,<br>
  Through letting go of lesser will,<br>
  I found that favor does not chase<br>
  The proud, but meets the lowly place.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">“And we know that in all things God<br>
  Works for the good, both wide and broad,<br>
  For those who love Him, walk His way—<br>
  He weaves the night into the day.”<br>
  — Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So if you’re standing where I stood,<br>
  Unsure if this is bad or good,<br>
  Remember this: God sees it all—<br>
  He writes His glory through your call.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s not just to you blessings flow,<br>
  But through you, others come to know<br>
  That favor's not for pride or show—<br>
  It’s how His love and truth will grow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">So take the step, though small, unsure,<br>
  Your trembling faith, He will secure.<br>
  And when you stand in heaven’s view,<br>
  You’ll see — God’s favor carried through.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">The Rubik’s Cube of Life</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">Life is like a Rubik’s Cube—<br>
  Twisted, turned, and sometimes crude.<br>
  The colors spin, the sides collide,<br>
  Each move I make, a step I slide.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven."<br>
  —Ecclesiastes 3:1</p>

  <p class="poem-line">At times, it feels like all is lost,<br>
  A tangled mess, no matter the cost.<br>
  I twist and turn, but nothing fits,<br>
  A puzzle broken into bits.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But in the chaos, I find a truth—<br>
  Even the mess has its own proof.<br>
  Each turn, each twist, each move I make,<br>
  Shapes the path that I must take.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."<br>
  —Romans 8:28</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Some pieces don't align just right,<br>
  But with patience, I see the light.<br>
  Through every wrong, a lesson learned,<br>
  In every loss, there’s something earned.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."<br>
  —Romans 5:3-4</p>

  <p class="poem-line">The cube of life may twist again,<br>
  But through the struggle, I find my zen.<br>
  For though it's hard to see the way,<br>
  In time, the pieces will obey.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands."<br>
  —Psalm 138:8</p>

  <p class="poem-line">It’s never perfect, this game I play,<br>
  But I find the pieces day by day.<br>
  Life may be a Rubik’s Cube, a test,<br>
  But I’ll fix myself—putting my soul to rest.</p>

  <p class="bible-verse">"I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength."<br>
  —Philippians 4:13</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Each twist, each turn, a chance to grow,<br>
  To heal, to change, to let love flow.<br>
  For in this cube, I see the grace—<br>
  That even in chaos, I find my place.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">No Turning Back: Manatiling Liwanag sa Dilim</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was lost, a soul adrift,<br>
  Caught in the wind, no steady lift.<br>
  I walked in doubt, I walked in fear,<br>
  My faith was small, my heart unclear.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I searched for answers on my own,<br>
  Through paths of pain, through seeds once sown.<br>
  But all I found were broken dreams,<br>
  A heart that cracked and lost its seams.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But then, a light broke through the dark,<br>
  A whisper called, igniting spark.<br>
  A hand that reached, a voice so kind,<br>
  Guided my heart, redefined.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">From unbelief, I learned to stand,<br>
  A life once lost, now in His hand.<br>
  The roots of faith began to grow,<br>
  And I was not the one to sow.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">For now, my faith is like a tree,<br>
  Planted firm in what I can't see.<br>
  Its roots run deep beneath the ground,<br>
  In the Lord’s love, I’ve found my sound.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No more a soul tossed by the storm,<br>
  For now I stand, my heart reborn.<br>
  Faith like a mountain, strong and tall,<br>
  I will not crumble, I will not fall.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I trust the path, I trust the way,<br>
  No matter what the world may say.<br>
  For His plans are greater than mine,<br>
  I walk by faith, His will divine.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I once was weak, but now I’m strong,<br>
  In Him, I find where I belong.<br>
  Faith is my fortress, faith is my song,<br>
  And with His grace, I will go long.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">No turning back, no second guess,<br>
  For my faith now is firm, no less.<br>
  It’s anchored deep, it’s built to last,<br>
  Rooted in truth, unshaken fast.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I stand today, I rise again,<br>
  In every storm, through every pain.<br>
  My faith is stronger, I won’t sway—<br>
  For with Proverbs 3:5-6, I’ll find my way.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <h2 class="poem-title">More Doesn’t Always Mean Worth</h2>

  <p class="poem-line">It was Easter Sunday.<br>
  My little sister looked up at me with bright eyes.<br>
  “Kuya, can we do the egg hunt? Just like before… with obasan?”<br>
  Her words brought me back to days filled with obasan’s laughter,<br>
  when joy echoed through the house like music.<br>
  I smiled.<br>
  “Ay yah, tara. Game.”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Together, we prepared the eggs—16 in total:<br>
  5 eggs with ₱500<br>
  5 eggs with ₱100<br>
  5 eggs with ₱200<br>
  1 special egg with ₱1,000</p>

  <p class="poem-line">We carefully tucked them away—<br>
  behind flower pots, under benches, inside slippers, beneath leaves—<br>
  laughing as we tried to be sneaky.<br>
  The kids waited eagerly inside the house, peeking through windows.<br>
  When the last egg was hidden, I shouted, “Okay, ready na!”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And off they ran.<br><br>
  Kenji, 8, found 3 eggs.<br>
  Alyssa, clever and quick, found 4.<br>
  Jomar, 17, snatched 7.<br>
  Two cousins found the last 2.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">After the search, they gathered, out of breath but grinning.<br>
  “Kuya, ang dami mong nakuha! Sana all!” Alyssa teased.<br>
  Jomar laughed, “Mabilis kasi ako maghanap!”</p>

  <p class="poem-line">But when we opened the eggs, the results surprised everyone.<br><br>
  Kenji, with 3 eggs, had ₱1,700<br>
  Alyssa, with 4 eggs, also had ₱1,700<br>
  Jomar, with 7 eggs, had ₱1,300<br>
  The cousins got ₱100 and ₱200</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jomar stared, confused.<br>
  He thought he’d won because he had the most.<br>
  But it wasn’t about how many—<br>
  it was about what was inside.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">I smiled and shared the lesson:<br>
  “Sa buhay, hindi palaging mas marami ang may pinakamataas na halaga.<br>
  Sometimes, the ones with the most don’t always have the most value.<br>
  It’s not about how much you have,<br>
  but about the heart behind it.”</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Widow’s Offering</strong> <em>(Mark 12:41–44)</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jesus was sitting near the temple treasury, watching people give their offerings.<br>
  The rich gave large sums, but a poor widow came forward,<br>
  giving only two small coins—less than a penny.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Jesus said to His disciples:<br>
  <em>“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">Her offering wasn’t large,<br>
  but it was great in heart.<br>
  She gave all she had,<br>
  and in God’s eyes, that was more valuable than the rich gifts of many others.</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>David’s Anointing</strong> <em>(1 Samuel 16:7)</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">When Samuel went to anoint the next king,<br>
  he saw Jesse’s sons—strong, tall, and impressive.<br>
  But God spoke to him and said:</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><em>“Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”</em></p>

  <p class="poem-line">God chose David, the youngest, a shepherd—<br>
  the one no one thought of.<br>
  God saw his heart, his faithfulness, and his love for God.<br>
  Outward appearances don’t matter to God; it’s the heart that counts.</p>

  <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Lesson:</strong><br><br>
  In life, it’s not about how much we have,<br>
  but what we carry inside.<br>
  Not the size of our offering, but the spirit in which we give it.<br>
  Not how we appear, but who we are at the core.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">Just like the egg hunt:<br>
  Those with fewer eggs received more in value.<br>
  It’s not always about quantity.<br>
  It’s about quality. Intent. Love.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And those two cousins—<br>
  they didn’t get the biggest prizes,<br>
  but they smiled just the same.<br>
  They weren’t chasing the money.<br>
  They were chasing the moment.</p>

  <p class="poem-line">And I whispered, “I remember of Obasan…”<br>
  I held the eggs, not for the cash inside,<br>
  but for the memory wrapped in plastic shells.<br>

  <!-- Reflection: Wisdom Was Shouting—But I Wasn’t Listening -->
  <div class="poem-container">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Wisdom Was Shouting—But I Wasn’t Listening</h2>
    <p class="poem-subtitle">(Proverbs Chapter 1, NIV)</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Purpose of the Book</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair...” — Proverbs 1:1–3 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">Proverbs begins with a purpose: to train our hearts and minds to make godly, wise decisions. It’s not just for the educated or religious—it’s written especially for the young, the ordinary, the ones still learning how to walk in life. In short: us. This book offers a roadmap for righteousness, teaching us how to live in a way that honors God and guards our future. And the foundation of all wisdom is made clear right away:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.” — Proverbs 1:7 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Personal Reflection: A Season I Chose the Crowd Over Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">I’ve lived Proverbs 1 before I even fully understood it. When my obasan passed away, I lost more than just a family member—I lost clarity. I was grieving, but instead of falling to my knees in prayer, I fell into the crowd. I joined my friends in drinking, escaping, ignoring the ache in my chest with temporary numbness. I knew it wasn’t right. I knew I was wasting my days.</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.” — Proverbs 1:10 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">But I did. Not because I was rebellious—but because I was tired, broken, and desperate to forget the pain. My decisions weren’t wise, and they certainly weren’t aligned with God’s will. I was living proof of verse 29:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord…” — Proverbs 1:29 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">But even when I turned away, wisdom never stopped calling. She was there, like in verse 20:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square.” — Proverbs 1:20 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Life Example: Rushing Into Love Without Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Have you ever rushed into a relationship just because you felt that spark, that instant connection? I remember a time when I saw a friend get so swept up in a new relationship. It felt like they were meant to be together—quick chemistry, fast promises. They were on cloud nine, ignoring the small but clear red flags that wisdom was whispering about. Soon enough, the relationship became toxic—built more on impulse than on thoughtful, prayerful decision-making. Emotions led the way, but they didn’t last.</p>

    <p class="poem-line"><em>“When you are so sad nor happy, do not decide easily.”</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">When love rushes in, it’s easy to let our emotions dictate our decisions. But wisdom calls us to slow down, to ask, “Is this person truly aligned with God’s will for my life? Is this the right relationship for me, or am I just caught up in the excitement?”</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>The Danger of Ignoring Wisdom</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">There is a shift in Proverbs 1—a warning. Verses 24–28 show us the consequence of ignoring God:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand… I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you…” — Proverbs 1:24, 26 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">It sounds harsh, but it’s real. Not because God is cruel—but because we often delay obedience until it’s too late. God is not a safety net we only pull in emergencies. Wisdom is preventative, not just protective.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">I’ve felt this. When my choices caught up with me, I found myself asking, “Why does God feel distant?” And the answer was simple—I had walked away. But even then, His grace was waiting.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Lessons and Application: What This Chapter Teaches Me</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Proverbs 1 reminds me that wisdom is active. It doesn’t sneak into your life—you must choose it. It doesn’t grow in comfort zones—it grows in correction. Verse 23 says:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.” — Proverbs 1:23 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">It implies a posture of humility. We must be willing to be corrected—not just by God, but even by people He sends. And that’s where another part of my life speaks. I once brushed off a pastor’s advice, thinking he didn’t understand my grief. Now I realize that open rebuke is a gift and better than secret love.</p>

    <p class="poem-line"><em>“Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are.”</em> This familiar saying echoes in this chapter. The people you surround yourself with can either lead you to righteousness or ruin. I’ve learned to stay close to people who will speak life, not just agree with my compromise.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">And lastly, I’ve learned that wisdom isn’t just about knowing Scripture—it’s about living it. To practice what it preach. To align every decision with God’s will. To obey even when it’s hard. Even when no one is watching.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Final Encouragement: The Promise Still Stands</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">Despite all the warnings and consequences listed in this chapter, Proverbs 1 ends with a beautiful promise:</p>

    <p class="poem-verse"><em>“But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.” — Proverbs 1:33 (NIV)</em></p>

    <p class="poem-line">This is the heart of it all. If you listen, if you turn, if you respond—God offers peace. Even if your past is messy. Even if you’ve ignored Him before. He doesn’t just give wisdom—He gives healing.</p>

    <p class="poem-section"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p class="poem-line">I once lived as someone who knew the right path but chose the wrong road. But I now live with stronger faith, not because I’m perfect, but because I know what it’s like to be forgiven. Proverbs 1 is not just a warning—it’s a second chance.</p>

    <p class="poem-line">Wisdom is still calling. And this time, I’m listening.</p>

    <h3 class="poem-section">The Confusion We All Face</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      You’ve heard it before:<br>
      "Maybe this is part of God’s will for me."<br>
      "Maybe God wanted this to happen to me."<br><br>
      And sometimes, when life gets difficult or when we mess up, we say things like this.<br>
      It’s an attempt to make sense of our pain, our mistakes, and the chaos that sometimes seems to control us.<br>
      We think, “Maybe this was meant to be.”<br><br>
      But what if I told you—not everything that happens is God’s will?<br>
      What if I told you that God allows us the freedom to choose, and sometimes those choices lead us down painful paths?<br><br>
      God doesn’t make us choose His way. He gives us free will—the ability to decide for ourselves. And it’s in those choices that we discover who we really are.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">BIBLICAL FOUNDATION: What Does God Really Say?</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">God’s will is not automatic; we must choose it.</p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”<br>
      — Matthew 6:10 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      If God’s will automatically happened, Jesus wouldn’t have prayed this.<br>
      He’s teaching us that God’s will doesn’t always just happen.<br>
      We are invited into it. We must choose it.<br>
      This is the power of free will: we get to decide whether or not we’ll align ourselves with God’s purposes.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">God gives us the power to choose</p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses… I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life…”<br>
      — Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      The very essence of free will is this: you choose.<br>
      God presents us with choices in life—life or death, blessings or curses.<br>
      He tells us the right one to choose, but He doesn’t force it upon us.<br>
      It’s up to us.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Think about it:<br>
      Every decision you make is a seed you plant, and one day, you’ll reap the harvest.<br>
      What are you planting today?
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Our decisions have results</p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.”<br>
      — Galatians 6:7 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      God doesn’t control every moment in our lives.<br>
      We do. We reap what we sow.<br><br>
      So ask yourself:<br>
      What choices have I made that led me to where I am?<br>
      Are there seeds I planted in anger, bitterness, or fear that I’m now reaping?<br>
      What do I want to plant today?
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">God never tempts us to sin</p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“When tempted, no one should say, ‘God is tempting me.’ For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone.”<br>
      — James 1:13 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      This is the hardest truth to accept, but it’s necessary: God doesn’t make us sin.<br>
      We are led astray by our own desires, by our own choices.<br>
      When things go wrong, when we fall into temptation, we can’t say, “God made me do it.”<br>
      God didn’t will your failure. You did.<br><br>
      But here’s the real question: Why did you choose that?<br>
      God gives you freedom to make choices—but that freedom comes with responsibility.
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">God’s Spirit leads us in a different way</p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”<br>
      — Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      When you’re led by God’s Spirit, you will see fruit like self-control, peace, and kindness.<br>
      If your decisions are filled with anger, violence, fear, or pride, that’s not God’s will.<br>
      It’s not His Spirit guiding you—it’s your emotions, your flesh, your pain.<br><br>
      So, when you make a choice in that heated moment, ask:<br>
      What fruit is this decision bearing?
    </p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">God can redeem our mistakes</p>

      — Romans 8:28 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Here’s the good news: God doesn’t waste a thing.<br>
      Even when we mess up, when our free will leads us down a painful road—He’s still with us.<br>
      He can turn what was meant for harm into something for good.<br>
      But first, we have to return to Him. We have to choose to surrender our choices to God, no matter how far we’ve strayed.

    <h3 class="poem-section">PERSONAL REFLECTION: After Obasan Passed-away, I Had a Choice</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      When my Obasan passed away, the grief hit like a storm.<br>
      It shook me to my core. For the first time in my life, I faced the loss of someone so close. I questioned everything.<br>
      "God, why did You let this happen?"<br><br>
      And in the face of that pain, I had a choice.<br>
      I could choose to turn to God for comfort, to lean on Him for healing.<br>
      But I didn’t.<br>
      Instead, I chose to numb the pain. I sought distractions. I made poor choices. I tried to fill the emptiness with everything but God.<br><br>
      I told myself, “Maybe God’s will is for me to go through this pain…”<br><br>
      But as I look back now, I see the truth:<br>
      That wasn’t God’s will.<br>
      It was my own decision—my own free will at work.<br>
      I chose to run from God in my pain, to rely on myself.<br>
      And that choice hurt me more.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">LIFE EXAMPLE: The Slap That Wasn’t God's Plan</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Imagine this:<br>
      You’re angry. Someone says something that triggers you—something deeply personal, something unfair.<br>
      You lash out. You slap the person in the heat of the moment.<br><br>
      In that second, it feels almost right, doesn’t it?<br>
      You might even think, “Maybe God allowed me to do this to teach me something.”<br><br>
      But let’s stop for a second.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>“The acts of the flesh are obvious: hatred, discord, fits of rage…”<br>
      — Galatians 5:19 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      That slap wasn’t God’s will.<br>
      It was human will—a decision made in the flesh, not the Spirit.<br>
      You can’t blame God for that.<br><br>
      But here’s the truth:<br>
      Even after we make those wrong choices—God still gives us a chance to choose again.<br>
      He doesn’t hold it against us. He just wants us to return to His peace, to His Spirit.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">THE LESSON: Stop Blaming God for What We Chose</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Here’s where we need to reflect:<br>
      When you mess up, do you own it?<br>
      Or do you push the blame on God, saying, “It was part of His plan”?<br><br>
      The reality is, we make decisions every day that shape our lives.<br>
      And we can’t keep blaming God for what was never His will in the first place.

    <h3 class="poem-section">CONCLUSION: Walk in Faith, Not in Blame</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      The beauty of free will is that it’s yours—but it also means that you must take responsibility for it.<br>
      Every choice you make matters.<br>
      Every action carries weight.<br><br>
      Today, I want you to ask yourself:<br>
      "Am I truly choosing God's way, or am I just letting my emotions lead?"<br>
      "Am I blaming God for the mess I created, or am I willing to choose His peace again?"<br><br>
      God has given you the freedom to decide—you get to choose.<br>
      So, what will you choose today?<br><br>
      Don’t waste your free will blaming God for what’s been your choice.<br>
      Instead, choose faith, even after failure.<br>
      Choose peace, even after anger.<br>
      Choose healing, even after the hurt.<br><br>
      And remember, it’s never too late to choose again.

    <p class="poem-subtitle">A reflection inspired by Ben Stuart’s *Single, Dating, Engaged, Married*</p>

    <p class="poem-line">
      I am not a man who just wait for love—I am a man preparing for it.<br>
      I’ve never entered a relationship, not because no one came along, but because I knew I wasn’t ready.<br>
      I wasn’t ready to carry the weight of commitment, to lead a woman spiritually, to build something I couldn’t yet protect.
      My silence in romance isn’t passivity—it’s preparation.

      That line resonated with my deepest conviction: before I pursue anyone, I must pursue God.<br>
      Because without Him at the center, love loses direction.

    <p class="poem-line">
      I believe in dating to marry—not out of fear, but out of vision.<br><br>
      This conviction isn't born from waiting for “the one.”<br>
      It comes from the calling to become the one who can lead well, love well, and build a family grounded in Christ.<br>
      I want to be a family-oriented, since I believe love is not just for enjoyment—it is for generational purpose.

    <h3 class="poem-section">FINAL WORD: A Heart-to-Heart with You</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Let me ask you something—<br>
      Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why you're waiting, or why you’re dating?<br><br>
      Are you pursuing love because you’re lonely, or because you’re ready?<br>
      Are you looking for someone to complete you, or are you letting God complete you first?<br><br>
      If you’re single right now, let me remind you: this isn’t a delay in your story—it’s development.<br>
      God is not punishing you with patience; He’s preparing you with purpose.<br><br>
      And if you’re dating, ask yourself:<br>
      Is this relationship helping you run harder toward Jesus, or making you slow down?<br><br>
      Ben Stuart was right—“Dating is for evaluation.”<br>
      So evaluate with prayer.<br>
      With peace.<br>
      With the wisdom of the Word.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      And for all the men out there who, like me, never experimented, and are still walking alone—not because we’re afraid, but because we’re intentional:<br><br>
      Don’t let the world shame you for being different.<br>
      Don’t let your silence be mistaken for weakness.<br>
      There is power in your patience.<br>
      There is honor in your preparation.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Because one day, when you stand before the woman you’ll love—with a steady hand and a surrendered heart—you’ll know:<br>
      You didn’t just wait for her.<br>
      You prepared for her.<br><br>
      And that, love built on rock—not sand.
    </p>

      <em>“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.”<br>
      — Proverbs 16:3 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      So whether you’re single, dating, or still discerning—walk in wisdom, walk with Him.<br>
    </p>

    <h3 class="poem-section">CONCLUSION</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      That's why, I’ve never dated.<br>
      Never tried to hold a heart I wasn’t ready to protect.<br>
      Not out of fear—but out of respect.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Ben Stuart reminded me that true freedom isn’t found in endless options, but in clear purpose.

      I’m not just avoiding mistakes—I’m preparing for meaning.<br>
      Not just looking for love—but building a life that can carry it.<br><br>
      I’m not waiting for someone to walk in.<br>
      I’m becoming the man who’ll be ready when she does.

      <em>"If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."<br>
      — 1 Corinthians 13:3 (NIV)</em>
    </p>

      <em>"And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love."<br>
      — 2 John 1:6 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">I. Love: The Foundation of All Things</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      I grew up learning to be strong.<br>
      My dad raised me to be independent — to work hard, to carry responsibilities, to not be a burden to anyone.<br>
      And for that, I’m forever grateful.<br><br>
      I learned early how to work not just for myself, but for my family, even for the people God placed in my life.<br><br>
      At first, my heart was pure: I wanted to help because I loved them.<br>
      But along the way, I didn’t notice that I became too eager to prove something to myself.<br>
      I thought: If I could just be rich enough, successful enough, they’ll be happy. And seeing them happy will make me happy too.<br><br>
      But Paul reminds us:<br>
      <em>"If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing."<br>
      — 1 Corinthians 13:3 (NIV)</em><br><br>
      Without love at the center, even the biggest sacrifices mean nothing.

      <em>"The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."<br>

    <p class="poem-line">
      It’s not about how much we achieve — it’s about how much we love while achieving.<br><br>
      John 3:16 shows us that real love is giving — not just things, but giving yourself.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">II. The Four Core Relationships</h3>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">1. Your Relationship with God</h4>
    <p class="poem-line">
      This is where it all starts.<br>
      When God is first, everything else finds its place.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."<br>
      — Matthew 6:33 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      I realized: no matter how much I worked, if I didn't prioritize God, I was only building a life with empty foundations.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">2. Your Relationship with Family</h4>
    <p class="poem-line">
      It hit me:<br>
      It was my mom reminding me to eat,<br>
      My dad checking if I was okay,<br>
      My little sister tugging my arm asking, "Kuya, can we go outside for snacks?"<br><br>
      They were the ones reaching out.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."<br>
      — 1 Timothy 5:8 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Providing doesn’t just mean money.<br>
      It means presence.<br>
      It means laughter, listening, shared life.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">3. Your Ministry</h4>
    <p class="poem-line">
      My work became my ministry — helping others, providing opportunities, lifting others up.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."<br>
      — Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Good works must flow from God’s heart — not just our own ambition.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">4. Your Relationship with Others</h4>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Every day, every interaction is an opportunity to love.<br>
      A smile to a stranger.<br>
      A patient word to someone who’s difficult.<br>
      A listening ear to someone who’s hurting.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."<br>
      — Colossians 3:14 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Love makes life whole.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">III. Loving in the Everyday</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Love isn’t about grand gestures all the time.<br>
      Sometimes it's quiet.<br><br>
      It’s:<br><br>
      Saying "yes" to a simple walk with my sister even when I'm tired.<br>
      Eating dinner together without checking my phone.<br>
      Choosing to listen without giving advice.<br><br>
      Real love shows up in the smallest moments.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity."<br>
      — Proverbs 17:17 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      At the end of the day, the real question isn’t, “What did I build today?”<br>
      It’s, “Whom did I love today?”
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">IV. Time: The Purest Expression of Love</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Time is life.<br>
      Time is love made visible.<br><br>
      And honestly, for a long time, I gave my time to everything except what mattered most.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."<br>
      — Psalm 90:12 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Because of that realization,<br>
      I decided to make a new schedule.<br>
      I lowered my working hours — giving space not just for work, but for myself and my family.<br><br>
      Because after all, no matter how many trophies, awards, or achievements I get.<br>
      I can’t bring them with me when this life ends.<br><br>
      But the love I gave?<br>
      The memories I built?<br>
      The faith I shared?<br>
      Those are eternal.

    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."<br>
      — Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">V. Don’t Miss What Truly Matters</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Many of us think, "I'll spend more time with them when I'm done with work..."<br>
      But the truth is — there will always be more work.<br>
      There will always be a reason to delay love.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?"<br>
      — Mark 8:36 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      I realized:<br>
      If I keep chasing success, but lose the people God gave me to love, I lose everything.<br><br>
      Even waking up each day is a gift.<br>
      A chance to love better.<br>
      A chance to be present.<br><br>
      When everything else fades away, only love will remain.<br>
      Love God. Love people.<br><br>
      Because in the end,<br>
      it’s not about how much we earned —<br>
      but how much we loved.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">Final Reminder: A Heart-to-Heart Talk</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Before you finish reading my reflection,<br>
      pause.<br><br>
      Ask yourself:<br>
      "Am I too busy chasing dreams that I’m missing the people and moments that matter most?"
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      If you find yourself overworking, overthinking, or overcommitting —<br>
      Remember this:<br><br>
      Reflect.<br>
      Slow down.<br>
      Realign your heart.<br><br>
      Because what if...<br><br>
      What if tomorrow you finally achieve everything you ever prayed for — but the people you love aren't there to celebrate it with you anymore?<br>
      What if you reach the top — but realize you're standing there alone?<br>
      What if you spend your life trying to give them "things" — when all they ever really wanted was you?
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      You don't have to lose everything to realize what truly matters.<br>
      You can start today.<br><br>
      Love louder.<br>
      Show up more.<br>
      Be present, not just busy.<br><br>
      Because at the end of it all,<br>
      it's not the trophies on your shelf,<br>
      not the money in your bank,<br>
      not the titles beside your name<br>
      — it’s the love you lived and the people you loved well that will echo into eternity.
    </p>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 
      By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."<br>
      — John 13:34-35 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      So if you’re tired today,<br>
      If you’re overwhelmed by all the things you "have" to do —<br>
      Breathe.<br><br>
      And ask yourself:<br>
      "Am I loving well today?"<br><br>
      Because love —<br>
      that’s what matters most.

      <em>"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone."<br>

    <h3 class="poem-section">Personal Reflection</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      There was a time I already believed in Jesus.<br>
      I knew Him.<br>
      I confessed Him as Lord.<br>
      But when I looked at my life — especially my words — it didn’t reflect Him.<br><br>
  
      I was a trashtalker.<br>
      Cursing was part of my daily expression.<br>
      Angry? Curse.<br>
      Joking? Curse.<br>
      Annoyed? Curse.<br>
      Happy? Curse.<br><br>
  
      It was automatic — I thought it was just my personality.<br>
      "This is me. If you don't like it, that's fine."<br><br>
  
      I thought that believing in Jesus was enough, even if my speech was still full of pride, anger, and harshness.<br>
      But deep inside, I felt a gap.<br><br>
  
      One day, I talked to someone who said something simple but powerful:<br>
      She's not used to people cursing and gently reminded me to lessen it.<br><br>
  
      At first, I defended myself.<br>
      I told her, "This is just who I am."<br>
      But her honesty planted a seed in me.<br>
      It stayed.<br>
      It bothered me — in a good way.<br><br>
  
      And before I even realized it, change started.<br>
      One day, instead of a curse word flying out when I was annoyed, I said "unggoy" — a harmless, silly word.<br>
      I laughed at myself — because I once thought it was impossible to change.<br>
      But here I was, speaking differently.<br><br>
  
      I learned that if you truly want to change, even with obstacles, you will find a way — and God will strengthen you.<br>
      Change begins in the heart, not the mouth.<br>
      And if you stand firm in your desire to honor Christ, He will meet you with His grace.

    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Many people think dirty jokes and foul language are harmless fun.<br>
      But in God's eyes, our words should be filled with thankfulness — not foolishness.<br>
      Even casual words matter to Him.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">3. Leave Behind the Old Way of Anger and Cursing</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips."<br>
      — Colossians 3:8-9 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      We can't hold onto Jesus with one hand and cling to our old sins with the other.<br>
      If we belong to Christ, we must let go of what once defined us — including the way we spoke.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">4. Put on the New Self in Christ</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"And have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."<br>
      — Colossians 3:10 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Change isn't just behavior modification.<br>
      It's a renewal — a rebirth into the image of Christ Himself.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">5. Let the Holy Spirit Speak Through You</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."<br>
      — Matthew 10:20 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      When we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us, even our conversations become anointed.<br>
      Instead of speaking carelessly, we begin to speak with divine purpose.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">6. Out of the Overflow of the Heart, the Mouth Speaks</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."<br>
      — Luke 6:45 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      If our words are full of bitterness, anger, pride, or filth,<br>
      It is only exposing what is hidden in the heart.<br>
      The real issue isn’t the tongue — it’s the heart.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">7. Speak Only What is Helpful and Uplifting</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."<br>
      — Ephesians 4:29 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      We are called to be builders, not destroyers.<br>
      Every word should be a brick that builds others up — not a stone that tears them down.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">8. Control the Tongue, Control the Whole Body</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check."<br>
      — James 3:2 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Mastering our speech is not a small achievement.<br>
      It reflects deep maturity and self-control in Christ.
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">9. Death and Life are in the Power of the Tongue</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit."<br>
      — Proverbs 18:21 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Every time we speak, we are either releasing life or death.<br>
      There is no neutral ground.<br>
      Are my words planting life or sowing death?
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="poem-subsection">10. Speak Truth in Love</h4>
    <p class="poem-scripture">
      <em>"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ."<br>
      — Ephesians 4:15 (NIV)</em>
    </p>
    <p class="poem-line">
      It’s not enough to just "tell the truth."<br>
      We must tell the truth in love — with gentleness, kindness, and wisdom, just like Jesus would.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">Realizations</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Maybe you already believe in Jesus — but does your speech reflect Him?<br>
  
      Maybe you’re kind in actions, but harsh in words — which still hurts others. <br>
  
      Maybe you’ve said, "I’m just being real," when in fact you were just being careless.<br>
  
      Maybe you never realized how many people you hurt or pushed away with your words — until now.<br>
  
      Today is the day to surrender our mouths to God — along with our hearts.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">Lesson Learned</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      Believing in Jesus means becoming like Jesus.<br>
      Not just on Sundays.<br>
      Not just in actions.<br>
      But even in the words we speak when no one is watching.<br><br>
      If we love Him, it should show — even in our conversations.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="poem-section">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="poem-line">
      When people hear you speak,<br>
      Do they hear the world?<br>
      Or do they hear Christ?<br><br>
  
      Let’s speak life.<br>
      Let’s speak hope.<br>
      Let’s speak Jesus.<br><br>
  
      Speak like Jesus.<br>
      Speak life.

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">Boundless Grace, Broken Chains</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by "O Come to the Altar")</p>

      <p class="poem-line">Are you tired? Tired of running, tired of hiding, tired of pretending you're okay? Does your soul feel heavy, like the weight of everything you've done is too much to carry?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Listen, there's a place where your burdens can rest, a place where the weight of your past doesn't define your future. It's not in your own strength, but in the open arms of grace.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">"O come to the altar," He calls, not with judgment, but with invitation—a Father's voice, asking you to come just as you are, broken and weary, and let His love make you whole.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The cross wasn't just a sacrifice—it was a declaration of freedom.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Nailed hands, open arms, saying, "Come, and lay down your chains." No matter the scars, no matter the shame—there is freedom in His name.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains. These aren't just words; they are a promise, a promise that your story doesn't end in defeat, but in redemption. Why wait?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Why carry the weight when He already carried it for you? Why live in fear when He has already overcome the grave?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">The altar is open—not a place of condemnation, but a place of healing. Come—drop your pain, drop your doubt, and let grace rewrite your story.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Boundless grace. Broken chains. The invitation is simple: Come to the altar, where love still bleeds for you, where you are made new, where your chains fall, and your soul is free.</p>

    <div class="poem-container">
      <h2 class="poem-title">The Ache That Prayer Holds</h2>
      <p class="poem-line">I still can't sleep tonight.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">My eyes are wide, but my heart is tired. I keep staring at the ceiling, hoping it would give me answers—answers to a question I never wanted to ask: Why so soon? Why you? Why now?</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Everything happened so fast. One moment, you were here—breathing, laughing, living. The next, you were a memory I wasn't ready to keep. A silence I never wanted to hear.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I still replay your voice in my mind, hold on to the echo of your laughter, as if remembering you could somehow bring you back. But it doesn't. And that truth crushes me over and over again.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">It doesn't feel real. Some days, I wait for a call that will never come. I hold back tears in crowded rooms, then weep alone when the world goes quiet.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Yet in this unbearable ache, I stand—shaking, grieving, questioning—but still standing. Because I believe in the God who never makes mistakes. Even when His ways feel like shattered glass beneath my feet.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">I trust Him. Even when my heart screams in confusion. I believe, even when I don't understand. And I hold on, even when letting go feels impossible.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Because I know—one day, this pain will bloom into peace. And somehow, it will be well... not because I feel it now, but because He said so.</p>
      <p class="bible-verse">"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." —Revelation 21:4</p>

    <!-- Poem 3 -->
    <div class="poem-container">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Faith that Lives Louder than Words</h2>
    <p class="poem-subtitle">(Inspired by Titus)</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Faith is more than a verse on your profile, more than words whispered in church pews. It is how you walk, how you live, how you love when no one is watching.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">It’s the discipline of rising when it's easier to stay down, the strength to choose kindness when anger feels justified, the courage to forgive before the apology ever comes.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Faith isn't loud with speeches—it is quiet with consistency. It doesn't boast, but it builds. It isn't for show, it's for surrender.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">You don’t need a mic to preach the gospel—your life is already speaking. The question is: What is it saying?</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Let your actions echo louder than your captions. Let your patience preach peace. Let your character be the sermon no one forgets.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">Because faith isn’t proven by perfection, but by persistence. By doing the next right thing when it's hard. By loving when it hurts. By believing when it breaks you.</p>
    <p class="poem-line">So live like grace shaped your backbone. Like truth fuels your tongue. Like heaven is watching—and cheering you on.</p>
    <p class="bible-verse">"They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him..." —Titus 1:16</p>

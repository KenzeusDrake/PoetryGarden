    <h2 class="poem-title">More Doesn’t Always Mean Worth</h2>
  
    <p class="poem-line">It was Easter Sunday.<br>
    My little sister looked up at me with bright eyes.<br>
    “Kuya, can we do the egg hunt? Just like before… with obasan?”<br>
    Her words brought me back to days filled with obasan’s laughter,<br>
    when joy echoed through the house like music.<br>
    I smiled.<br>
    “Ay yah, tara. Game.”</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Together, we prepared the eggs—16 in total:<br>
    5 eggs with ₱500<br>
    5 eggs with ₱100<br>
    5 eggs with ₱200<br>
    1 special egg with ₱1,000</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">We carefully tucked them away—<br>
    behind flower pots, under benches, inside slippers, beneath leaves—<br>
    laughing as we tried to be sneaky.<br>
    The kids waited eagerly inside the house, peeking through windows.<br>
    When the last egg was hidden, I shouted, “Okay, ready na!”</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">And off they ran.<br><br>
    Kenji, 8, found 3 eggs.<br>
    Alyssa, clever and quick, found 4.<br>
    Jomar, 17, snatched 7.<br>
    Two cousins found the last 2.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">After the search, they gathered, out of breath but grinning.<br>
    “Kuya, ang dami mong nakuha! Sana all!” Alyssa teased.<br>
    Jomar laughed, “Mabilis kasi ako maghanap!”</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">But when we opened the eggs, the results surprised everyone.<br><br>
    Kenji, with 3 eggs, had ₱1,700<br>
    Alyssa, with 4 eggs, also had ₱1,700<br>
    Jomar, with 7 eggs, had ₱1,300<br>
    The cousins got ₱100 and ₱200</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Jomar stared, confused.<br>
    He thought he’d won because he had the most.<br>
    But it wasn’t about how many—<br>
    it was about what was inside.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">I smiled and shared the lesson:<br>
    “Sa buhay, hindi palaging mas marami ang may pinakamataas na halaga.<br>
    Sometimes, the ones with the most don’t always have the most value.<br>
    It’s not about how much you have,<br>
    but about the heart behind it.”</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Widow’s Offering</strong> <em>(Mark 12:41–44)</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Jesus was sitting near the temple treasury, watching people give their offerings.<br>
    The rich gave large sums, but a poor widow came forward,<br>
    giving only two small coins—less than a penny.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Jesus said to His disciples:<br>
    <em>“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Her offering wasn’t large,<br>
    but it was great in heart.<br>
    She gave all she had,<br>
    and in God’s eyes, that was more valuable than the rich gifts of many others.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line"><strong>David’s Anointing</strong> <em>(1 Samuel 16:7)</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">When Samuel went to anoint the next king,<br>
    he saw Jesse’s sons—strong, tall, and impressive.<br>
    But God spoke to him and said:</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line"><em>“Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">God chose David, the youngest, a shepherd—<br>
    the one no one thought of.<br>
    God saw his heart, his faithfulness, and his love for God.<br>
    Outward appearances don’t matter to God; it’s the heart that counts.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line"><strong>The Lesson:</strong><br><br>
    In life, it’s not about how much we have,<br>
    but what we carry inside.<br>
    Not the size of our offering, but the spirit in which we give it.<br>
    Not how we appear, but who we are at the core.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Just like the egg hunt:<br>
    Those with fewer eggs received more in value.<br>
    It’s not always about quantity.<br>
    It’s about quality. Intent. Love.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">And those two cousins—<br>
    they didn’t get the biggest prizes,<br>
    but they smiled just the same.<br>
    They weren’t chasing the money.<br>
    They were chasing the moment.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">And I whispered, “I remember of Obasan…”<br>
    I held the eggs, not for the cash inside,<br>
    but for the memory wrapped in plastic shells.<br>
    The joy of the search.<br>
    The laughter of family.<br>
    The feeling of being together.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">Sometimes, the greatest prize isn't in the egg—<br>
    but in the moment you shared looking for it.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line"><strong><em>Mark 10:31 (NIV):</em></strong><br>
    <em>“But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</em></p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">In God’s eyes,<br>
    those who seem to have the least<br>
    often hold the richest treasures.</p>
  
    <p class="poem-line">So, in the end,<br>
    it’s not about how many eggs you find,<br>
    or how much you gain.<br>
    It’s about what you do with what you have,<br>
    and whether you offer it with a heart that loves, remembers, and trusts in God.</p>

        <h2 class="poem-title">Who Are You Turning Away?</h2>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Main Verse:</h3>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Deuteronomy 23:15–16 (NIV)<br>“If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand them over to their master. Let them live among you wherever they like and in whatever town they choose. Do not oppress them.”</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Reflection:</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Imagine someone walking into a church—worn out, uncertain, carrying the weight of a broken past. <br>
          They don’t know the right words, they don't fit the usual mold, but there is something sincere in their eyes: they want to change. They want to serve God.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          This passage from Deuteronomy isn't just about ancient customs—it reflects God's heart today. <br>
          He sees the outcast, the broken, and the one who has escaped bondage. <br>
          And He commands His people: “Let them stay. Welcome them. Do not oppress.”
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">God’s Heart Is for Restoration, Not Rejection</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Too often, we fall into judging those who are just beginning their journey to faith. <br>
          But the truth is, everyone starts somewhere. True service begins with acceptance, not judgment.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">John 17:12 (NIV):<br>“While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We are called to do the same—to guard, nurture, and guide those entrusted to us, especially when they are most vulnerable.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">When God Entrusts You with Souls…</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Like David, we must be ready to fight for the spiritual lives placed under our care:
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">1 Samuel 17:34–36 (NIV):<br>“When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We must be willing to pursue, protect, and pray for those who are hungry for God.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">We Fight Differently in the Kingdom</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          You won’t win battles for souls by argument or pressure.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Mark 9:29 (NIV):<br>“This kind can come out only by prayer.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Some strongholds won't break unless we are serious about spiritual warfare. <br>
          Prayer and fasting are our real weapons.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Feed Those Who Are Hungry for God</h3>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Mark 7:27 (NIV):<br>“First let the children eat all they want,” he told her, “for it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Jesus was teaching us that the bread is for those who recognize their hunger. <br>
          Focus your efforts on those who are truly open to receive.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Balance Acceptance with Discipline</h3>
        <p class="poem-scripture">2 Thessalonians 3:10–12 (NIV):<br>“The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat... Such people we command... to settle down and earn the food they eat.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Discipleship is not just about comfort—it’s about growth. <br>
          Grace without guidance leads to stagnation. <br>
          We must lovingly teach responsibility and discipline.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Final Reflection</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So, who have you unintentionally pushed away? <br>
          Who have you given up on because they were still messy?
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Jesus didn’t wait until people were perfect. He walked with them while they were still changing. <br>
          You don’t have to be their Savior—just their shepherd.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Takeaway Lesson</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Accept those sincerely seeking God.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Intercede and fast for the weak.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Teach with love and truth.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Be a safe place, not a gatekeeper. <br>
          Let them come. Let them stay. Let them grow.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">For the reader</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I pray that the one reading this will not grow tired of welcoming the weak, the weary, and the wandering. <br>
          May your heart remain soft and your spirit sensitive to those who are seeking God, even if they come broken or unfinished. <br>
          I pray that you will fight for souls—not with force, but with faith; not with frustration, but with fasting and prayer. <br>
          May you become a safe place for the lost, a shepherd for the searching, and a servant for those finding their way.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Let your hands be ready to lift, not push away. <br>
          Let your words speak life, not judgment. <br>
          And may your life reflect the mercy and patience Christ showed to you.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Let them come. Let them stay. Let them grow—with you, beside you, and closer to God. Amen.

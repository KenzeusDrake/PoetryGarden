        <h2 class="poem-title">“Preparing the Ground: A Man’s Quiet Pursuit of Covenant Love”</h2>
        <p class="poem-subtitle">A reflection inspired by Ben Stuart’s *Single, Dating, Engaged, Married*</p>
    
        <p class="poem-line">
          I am not a man who just wait for love—I am a man preparing for it.<br>
          I’ve never entered a relationship, not because no one came along, but because I knew I wasn’t ready.<br>
          I wasn’t ready to carry the weight of commitment, to lead a woman spiritually, to build something I couldn’t yet protect.
          My silence in romance isn’t passivity—it’s preparation.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“In the end, the happiest people are not those who are actively seeking a mate, but those who are actively seeking their Maker.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          That line resonated with my deepest conviction: before I pursue anyone, I must pursue God.<br>
          Because without Him at the center, love loses direction.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”<br>
          — Matthew 6:33 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">MY CHOICE: DATE TO MARRY</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I believe in dating to marry—not out of fear, but out of vision.<br><br>
          This conviction isn't born from waiting for “the one.”<br>
          It comes from the calling to become the one who can lead well, love well, and build a family grounded in Christ.<br>
          I want to be a family-oriented, since I believe love is not just for enjoyment—it is for generational purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“You want someone with character—not perfect, but perfectable, because he or she is submitted to the Lord and longs to do his will.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So I’ve stopped asking God for her—and started asking Him to form me.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”<br>

        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">EXPANDED LESSONS FROM THE BOOK</h3>
        <p class="poem-line"><strong>1. Singleness Is a Sacred Season</strong><br>
          Stuart explains that singleness isn’t a holding cell—it’s a place of preparation and purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Singleness does not exist simply as an extended adolescence, a pursuit of career ambition, or a preparatory phase for marriage.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          This season is my soil.<br>
          It's where I build strength, faith, and clarity—not just for love, but for life.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.”<br>
          — Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line"><strong>2. Dating Is for Discernment, Not Entertainment</strong></p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Dating is the modern process of evaluation we use to find that person to marry.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I don't date to experiment—I date to evaluate.<br>
          I don’t need attention; I need alignment.<br>
          I don’t need butterflies; I need clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.”<br>
          — Proverbs 22:3 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line"><strong>3. Your Relationship with God Comes First</strong></p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“We must get a relationship with God right before we can get a relationship with a guy or a girl right.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I don’t want to drag a broken heart into a holy union.<br>
          I want my walk with God to be solid enough to hold someone else’s trust.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.”<br>
          — Psalm 127:1 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line"><strong>4. Sexual Purity Is About Purpose, Not Pressure</strong></p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          In a world that mocks restraint, I’ve learned that purity is not denial—it’s devotion.<br>
          It’s not saying no to passion, it’s saying yes to God’s design.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality.”<br>
          — 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <p class="poem-line"><strong>5. Marriage Is a Missional Union</strong></p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I don’t desire marriage for comfort—I desire it for calling.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“We want to be right in the center of what God is doing until the day he calls us home... marriages on mission know that death is the finish line for those in the service of God.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          To me, family is a mission field.<br>
          How I love my wife and raise my children will preach louder than any sermon I give.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”<br>
          — Joshua 24:15 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">FINAL WORD: A Heart-to-Heart with You</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Let me ask you something—<br>
          Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why you're waiting, or why you’re dating?<br><br>
          Are you pursuing love because you’re lonely, or because you’re ready?<br>
          Are you looking for someone to complete you, or are you letting God complete you first?<br><br>
          If you’re single right now, let me remind you: this isn’t a delay in your story—it’s development.<br>
          God is not punishing you with patience; He’s preparing you with purpose.<br><br>
          And if you’re dating, ask yourself:<br>
          Is this relationship helping you run harder toward Jesus, or making you slow down?<br><br>
          Ben Stuart was right—“Dating is for evaluation.”<br>
          So evaluate with prayer.<br>
          With peace.<br>
          With the wisdom of the Word.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          And for all the men out there who, like me, never experimented, and are still walking alone—not because we’re afraid, but because we’re intentional:<br><br>
          Don’t let the world shame you for being different.<br>
          Don’t let your silence be mistaken for weakness.<br>
          There is power in your patience.<br>
          There is honor in your preparation.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because one day, when you stand before the woman you’ll love—with a steady hand and a surrendered heart—you’ll know:<br>
          You didn’t just wait for her.<br>
          You prepared for her.<br><br>
          And that, love built on rock—not sand.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.”<br>
          — Proverbs 16:3 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So whether you’re single, dating, or still discerning—walk in wisdom, walk with Him.<br>
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="poem-section">CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          That's why, I’ve never dated.<br>
          Never tried to hold a heart I wasn’t ready to protect.<br>
          Not out of fear—but out of respect.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Ben Stuart reminded me that true freedom isn’t found in endless options, but in clear purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Freedom is not the absence of boundaries; it is the ability to fulfill created intent.”<br>
          — from the book</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>“Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.”<br>
          — Psalm 37:7 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I’m not just avoiding mistakes—I’m preparing for meaning.<br>
          Not just looking for love—but building a life that can carry it.<br><br>
          I’m not waiting for someone to walk in.<br>
          I’m becoming the man who’ll be ready when she does.

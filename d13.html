        <h2 class="poem-title">Let's Speak Like Jesus</h2>
        <p class="poem-subtitle">A Reflection on Words that Honor Christ</p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Main Verse</h3>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone."<br>
          — Colossians 4:6 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          There was a time I already believed in Jesus.<br>
          I knew Him.<br>
          I confessed Him as Lord.<br>
          But when I looked at my life — especially my words — it didn’t reflect Him.<br><br>
      
          I was a trashtalker.<br>
          Cursing was part of my daily expression.<br>
          Angry? Curse.<br>
          Joking? Curse.<br>
          Annoyed? Curse.<br>
          Happy? Curse.<br><br>
      
          It was automatic — I thought it was just my personality.<br>
          "This is me. If you don't like it, that's fine."<br><br>
      
          I thought that believing in Jesus was enough, even if my speech was still full of pride, anger, and harshness.<br>
          But deep inside, I felt a gap.<br><br>
      
          One day, I talked to someone who said something simple but powerful:<br>
          She's not used to people cursing and gently reminded me to lessen it.<br><br>
      
          At first, I defended myself.<br>
          I told her, "This is just who I am."<br>
          But her honesty planted a seed in me.<br>
          It stayed.<br>
          It bothered me — in a good way.<br><br>
      
          And before I even realized it, change started.<br>
          One day, instead of a curse word flying out when I was annoyed, I said "unggoy" — a harmless, silly word.<br>
          I laughed at myself — because I once thought it was impossible to change.<br>
          But here I was, speaking differently.<br><br>
      
          I learned that if you truly want to change, even with obstacles, you will find a way — and God will strengthen you.<br>
          Change begins in the heart, not the mouth.<br>
          And if you stand firm in your desire to honor Christ, He will meet you with His grace.

        <h3 class="poem-section">Related Topics</h3>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">1. Speak with Wisdom and Grace</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone."<br>
          — Colossians 4:5-6 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Our words are not random.<br>
          They are opportunities — either to invite people closer to Jesus or push them farther away.<br>
          When we speak, we are either building bridges or building walls.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">2. Avoid Obscene, Foolish, and Dirty Talk</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving."<br>
          — Ephesians 5:4 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Many people think dirty jokes and foul language are harmless fun.<br>
          But in God's eyes, our words should be filled with thankfulness — not foolishness.<br>
          Even casual words matter to Him.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">3. Leave Behind the Old Way of Anger and Cursing</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips."<br>
          — Colossians 3:8-9 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We can't hold onto Jesus with one hand and cling to our old sins with the other.<br>
          If we belong to Christ, we must let go of what once defined us — including the way we spoke.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">4. Put on the New Self in Christ</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"And have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."<br>
          — Colossians 3:10 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Change isn't just behavior modification.<br>
          It's a renewal — a rebirth into the image of Christ Himself.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">5. Let the Holy Spirit Speak Through You</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."<br>
          — Matthew 10:20 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          When we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us, even our conversations become anointed.<br>
          Instead of speaking carelessly, we begin to speak with divine purpose.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">6. Out of the Overflow of the Heart, the Mouth Speaks</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."<br>
          — Luke 6:45 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          If our words are full of bitterness, anger, pride, or filth,<br>
          It is only exposing what is hidden in the heart.<br>
          The real issue isn’t the tongue — it’s the heart.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">7. Speak Only What is Helpful and Uplifting</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."<br>
          — Ephesians 4:29 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          We are called to be builders, not destroyers.<br>
          Every word should be a brick that builds others up — not a stone that tears them down.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">8. Control the Tongue, Control the Whole Body</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check."<br>
          — James 3:2 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Mastering our speech is not a small achievement.<br>
          It reflects deep maturity and self-control in Christ.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">9. Death and Life are in the Power of the Tongue</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit."<br>
          — Proverbs 18:21 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Every time we speak, we are either releasing life or death.<br>
          There is no neutral ground.<br>
          Are my words planting life or sowing death?
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="poem-subsection">10. Speak Truth in Love</h4>
        <p class="poem-scripture">
          <em>"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ."<br>
          — Ephesians 4:15 (NIV)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          It’s not enough to just "tell the truth."<br>
          We must tell the truth in love — with gentleness, kindness, and wisdom, just like Jesus would.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Realizations</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Maybe you already believe in Jesus — but does your speech reflect Him?<br>
      
          Maybe you’re kind in actions, but harsh in words — which still hurts others. <br>
      
          Maybe you’ve said, "I’m just being real," when in fact you were just being careless.<br>
      
          Maybe you never realized how many people you hurt or pushed away with your words — until now.<br>
      
          Today is the day to surrender our mouths to God — along with our hearts.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Lesson Learned</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Believing in Jesus means becoming like Jesus.<br>
          Not just on Sundays.<br>
          Not just in actions.<br>
          But even in the words we speak when no one is watching.<br><br>
          If we love Him, it should show — even in our conversations.
        </p>
      
        <h3 class="poem-section">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="poem-line">
          When people hear you speak,<br>
          Do they hear the world?<br>
          Or do they hear Christ?<br><br>
      
          Let’s speak life.<br>
          Let’s speak hope.<br>
          Let’s speak Jesus.<br><br>
      
          Speak like Jesus.<br>
          Speak life.

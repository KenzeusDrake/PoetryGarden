      <h2 class="poem-title">“When It Wasn’t God’s Will—It Was Just My Choice”</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">A Reflective Piece on Free Will, Broken Moments, and Walking Back by Faith</p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">The Confusion We All Face</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        You’ve heard it before:<br>
        "Maybe this is part of God’s will for me."<br>
        "Maybe God wanted this to happen to me."<br><br>
        And sometimes, when life gets difficult or when we mess up, we say things like this.<br>
        It’s an attempt to make sense of our pain, our mistakes, and the chaos that sometimes seems to control us.<br>
        We think, “Maybe this was meant to be.”<br><br>
        But what if I told you—not everything that happens is God’s will?<br>
        What if I told you that God allows us the freedom to choose, and sometimes those choices lead us down painful paths?<br><br>
        God doesn’t make us choose His way. He gives us free will—the ability to decide for ourselves. And it’s in those choices that we discover who we really are.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">BIBLICAL FOUNDATION: What Does God Really Say?</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">God’s will is not automatic; we must choose it.</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”<br>
        — Matthew 6:10 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        If God’s will automatically happened, Jesus wouldn’t have prayed this.<br>
        He’s teaching us that God’s will doesn’t always just happen.<br>
        We are invited into it. We must choose it.<br>
        This is the power of free will: we get to decide whether or not we’ll align ourselves with God’s purposes.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God gives us the power to choose</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses… I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life…”<br>
        — Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        The very essence of free will is this: you choose.<br>
        God presents us with choices in life—life or death, blessings or curses.<br>
        He tells us the right one to choose, but He doesn’t force it upon us.<br>
        It’s up to us.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Think about it:<br>
        Every decision you make is a seed you plant, and one day, you’ll reap the harvest.<br>
        What are you planting today?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Our decisions have results</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.”<br>
        — Galatians 6:7 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        God doesn’t control every moment in our lives.<br>
        We do. We reap what we sow.<br><br>
        So ask yourself:<br>
        What choices have I made that led me to where I am?<br>
        Are there seeds I planted in anger, bitterness, or fear that I’m now reaping?<br>
        What do I want to plant today?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God never tempts us to sin</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“When tempted, no one should say, ‘God is tempting me.’ For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone.”<br>
        — James 1:13 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This is the hardest truth to accept, but it’s necessary: God doesn’t make us sin.<br>
        We are led astray by our own desires, by our own choices.<br>
        When things go wrong, when we fall into temptation, we can’t say, “God made me do it.”<br>
        God didn’t will your failure. You did.<br><br>
        But here’s the real question: Why did you choose that?<br>
        God gives you freedom to make choices—but that freedom comes with responsibility.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God’s Spirit leads us in a different way</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”<br>
        — Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        When you’re led by God’s Spirit, you will see fruit like self-control, peace, and kindness.<br>
        If your decisions are filled with anger, violence, fear, or pride, that’s not God’s will.<br>
        It’s not His Spirit guiding you—it’s your emotions, your flesh, your pain.<br><br>
        So, when you make a choice in that heated moment, ask:<br>
        What fruit is this decision bearing?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God can redeem our mistakes</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him…”<br>
        — Romans 8:28 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Here’s the good news: God doesn’t waste a thing.<br>
        Even when we mess up, when our free will leads us down a painful road—He’s still with us.<br>
        He can turn what was meant for harm into something for good.<br>
        But first, we have to return to Him. We have to choose to surrender our choices to God, no matter how far we’ve strayed.

      <h3 class="poem-section">PERSONAL REFLECTION: After Obasan Passed-away, I Had a Choice</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        When my Obasan passed away, the grief hit like a storm.<br>
        It shook me to my core. For the first time in my life, I faced the loss of someone so close. I questioned everything.<br>
        "God, why did You let this happen?"<br><br>
        And in the face of that pain, I had a choice.<br>
        I could choose to turn to God for comfort, to lean on Him for healing.<br>
        But I didn’t.<br>
        Instead, I chose to numb the pain. I sought distractions. I made poor choices. I tried to fill the emptiness with everything but God.<br><br>
        I told myself, “Maybe God’s will is for me to go through this pain…”<br><br>
        But as I look back now, I see the truth:<br>
        That wasn’t God’s will.<br>
        It was my own decision—my own free will at work.<br>
        I chose to run from God in my pain, to rely on myself.<br>
        And that choice hurt me more.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">LIFE EXAMPLE: The Slap That Wasn’t God's Plan</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Imagine this:<br>
        You’re angry. Someone says something that triggers you—something deeply personal, something unfair.<br>
        You lash out. You slap the person in the heat of the moment.<br><br>
        In that second, it feels almost right, doesn’t it?<br>
        You might even think, “Maybe God allowed me to do this to teach me something.”<br><br>
        But let’s stop for a second.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“The acts of the flesh are obvious: hatred, discord, fits of rage…”<br>
        — Galatians 5:19 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        That slap wasn’t God’s will.<br>
        It was human will—a decision made in the flesh, not the Spirit.<br>
        You can’t blame God for that.<br><br>
        But here’s the truth:<br>
        Even after we make those wrong choices—God still gives us a chance to choose again.<br>
        He doesn’t hold it against us. He just wants us to return to His peace, to His Spirit.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">THE LESSON: Stop Blaming God for What We Chose</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Here’s where we need to reflect:<br>
        When you mess up, do you own it?<br>
        Or do you push the blame on God, saying, “It was part of His plan”?<br><br>
        The reality is, we make decisions every day that shape our lives.<br>
        And we can’t keep blaming God for what was never His will in the first place.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">CONCLUSION: Walk in Faith, Not in Blame</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        The beauty of free will is that it’s yours—but it also means that you must take responsibility for it.<br>
        Every choice you make matters.<br>
        Every action carries weight.<br><br>
        Today, I want you to ask yourself:<br>
        "Am I truly choosing God's way, or am I just letting my emotions lead?"<br>
        "Am I blaming God for the mess I created, or am I willing to choose His peace again?"<br><br>
        God has given you the freedom to decide—you get to choose.<br>
        So, what will you choose today?<br><br>
        Don’t waste your free will blaming God for what’s been your choice.<br>
        Instead, choose faith, even after failure.<br>
        Choose peace, even after anger.<br>
        Choose healing, even after the hurt.<br><br>
        And remember, it’s never too late to choose again.

      <!-- <h3 class="poem-section">PERSONAL REFLECTION</h3> -->
      <p class="poem-line">
        I am not a man who just wait for love—I am a man preparing for it.<br>
        I’ve never entered a relationship, not because no one came along, but because I knew I wasn’t ready.<br>
        I wasn’t ready to carry the weight of commitment, to lead a woman spiritually, to build something I couldn’t yet protect.
        My silence in romance isn’t passivity—it’s preparation.

        That line resonated with my deepest conviction: before I pursue anyone, I must pursue God.<br>

        I believe in dating to marry—not out of fear, but out of vision.<br><br>
        This conviction isn't born from waiting for “the one.”<br>
        It comes from the calling to become the one who can lead well, love well, and build a family grounded in Christ.<br>

      <p class="poem-line">
        Let me ask you something—<br>
        Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why you're waiting, or why you’re dating?<br><br>
        Are you pursuing love because you’re lonely, or because you’re ready?<br>
        Are you looking for someone to complete you, or are you letting God complete you first?<br><br>
        If you’re single right now, let me remind you: this isn’t a delay in your story—it’s development.<br>
        God is not punishing you with patience; He’s preparing you with purpose.<br><br>
        And if you’re dating, ask yourself:<br>
        Is this relationship helping you run harder toward Jesus, or making you slow down?<br><br>
        Ben Stuart was right—“Dating is for evaluation.”<br>
        So evaluate with prayer.<br>
        With peace.<br>
        With the wisdom of the Word.

        Don’t let the world shame you for being different.<br>
        Don’t let your silence be mistaken for weakness.<br>
        There is power in your patience.<br>
        There is honor in your preparation.

        Because one day, when you stand before the woman you’ll love—with a steady hand and a surrendered heart—you’ll know:<br>
        You didn’t just wait for her.<br>
        You prepared for her.<br><br>
        And that, love built on rock—not sand.

      <h2 class="poem-title">Oil in the Chat Window – A Reflection on Matthew 25</h2>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        There was a time when someone reached out to me in the midst of his struggle. He was going through a heavy season of anxiety and depression, and his faith was shaken. He told me he had walked away from God because he couldn’t understand why a loving God would allow him to experience such deep pain. His heart was heavy, and he felt disconnected, alone, and unsure of where to turn.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        At that moment, I realized that he wasn’t asking for answers or for me to fix everything. He needed someone to listen, to hear his pain without judgment or immediate solutions. So, I did just that. I didn’t rush to give him Bible verses or try to explain his suffering. I simply validated his feelings, acknowledging that what he was going through was difficult and real. I knew that right then, he didn’t need preaching; he needed a presence, a listening ear, and compassion.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This experience reminded me of the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25:1–13. Jesus tells a story of ten virgins who are waiting for the bridegroom. Five were wise and had extra oil for their lamps, while the other five foolishly did not prepare. When the bridegroom came, those who had no oil were shut out, while the wise virgins were ready and went in to the celebration.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        In reflecting on this parable, I understood that being prepared isn’t just about having the right answers or knowledge. It’s about having enough oil in your lamp to sustain the light, even when things get dark. The oil in this story is not just a symbol of preparation but of readiness to offer something meaningful, even when we don’t have all the answers. The wise virgins didn’t just keep the oil for themselves—they were ready to enter the celebration, prepared to share in the joy of the bridegroom’s arrival.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        In the same way, when someone comes to us in his time of need, it’s not always about giving him the right verses or solutions. Sometimes, we are called to be the instrument of God’s presence. Our role isn’t to preach or force him into faith but to simply be there, offering the oil of patience, understanding, and love. We are the instruments through which God’s love can flow. Even when he isn’t ready for scripture, we can still be the hands and feet of Christ by being present, listening, and validating his feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        I remember how, in my conversation with him, I didn’t feel the need to impose scripture immediately. I knew he wasn’t in a place to receive it, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t speak words of hope and compassion. I simply reminded him that his pain was real, and it was okay to question. It was okay to feel lost or broken. I reassured him that, even when it felt like God was far, He was still there, even if it wasn’t always obvious. I wasn’t preaching at him. Instead, I became an instrument of God’s love in that moment, offering him the comfort of knowing he wasn’t alone, even in his doubt.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        I realized that, sometimes, our role as followers of Christ is not to force faith on someone but to become conduits of His presence.

      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This comfort, this oil, is what we carry in moments of darkness. It’s not about having all the right answers, but about being prepared to offer the light we have, the oil in our lamps, to someone who is struggling.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Just as the wise virgins were prepared for the bridegroom’s arrival, we are called to be prepared—prepared to offer empathy, compassion, and the love of Christ. We may not always have the right words, but our presence, our willingness to listen, and our commitment to walk alongside someone in his pain are enough.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Through this, I understood that being an instrument of the Lord is not about forcing faith onto someone. It’s about allowing God’s love to flow through us, offering peace, understanding, and compassion when others are in need. And even when he’s not ready for scripture, when he feels disconnected or lost, we can still be a reflection of His love—ready, waiting, and prepared to show His presence in a way he can receive.

      <h2 class="poem-title">“When It Wasn’t God’s Will—It Was Just My Choice”</h2>
      <p class="poem-subtitle">A Reflective Piece on Free Will, Broken Moments, and Walking Back by Faith</p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">The Confusion We All Face</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        You’ve heard it before:<br>
        "Maybe this is part of God’s will for me."<br>
        "Maybe God wanted this to happen to me."<br><br>
        And sometimes, when life gets difficult or when we mess up, we say things like this.<br>
        It’s an attempt to make sense of our pain, our mistakes, and the chaos that sometimes seems to control us.<br>
        We think, “Maybe this was meant to be.”<br><br>
        But what if I told you—not everything that happens is God’s will?<br>
        What if I told you that God allows us the freedom to choose, and sometimes those choices lead us down painful paths?<br><br>
        God doesn’t make us choose His way. He gives us free will—the ability to decide for ourselves. And it’s in those choices that we discover who we really are.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">BIBLICAL FOUNDATION: What Does God Really Say?</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">God’s will is not automatic; we must choose it.</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”<br>
        — Matthew 6:10 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        If God’s will automatically happened, Jesus wouldn’t have prayed this.<br>
        He’s teaching us that God’s will doesn’t always just happen.<br>
        We are invited into it. We must choose it.<br>
        This is the power of free will: we get to decide whether or not we’ll align ourselves with God’s purposes.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God gives us the power to choose</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses… I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life…”<br>
        — Deuteronomy 30:19 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        The very essence of free will is this: you choose.<br>
        God presents us with choices in life—life or death, blessings or curses.<br>
        He tells us the right one to choose, but He doesn’t force it upon us.<br>
        It’s up to us.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Think about it:<br>
        Every decision you make is a seed you plant, and one day, you’ll reap the harvest.<br>
        What are you planting today?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">Our decisions have results</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.”<br>
        — Galatians 6:7 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        God doesn’t control every moment in our lives.<br>
        We do. We reap what we sow.<br><br>
        So ask yourself:<br>
        What choices have I made that led me to where I am?<br>
        Are there seeds I planted in anger, bitterness, or fear that I’m now reaping?<br>
        What do I want to plant today?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God never tempts us to sin</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“When tempted, no one should say, ‘God is tempting me.’ For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone.”<br>
        — James 1:13 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This is the hardest truth to accept, but it’s necessary: God doesn’t make us sin.<br>
        We are led astray by our own desires, by our own choices.<br>
        When things go wrong, when we fall into temptation, we can’t say, “God made me do it.”<br>
        God didn’t will your failure. You did.<br><br>
        But here’s the real question: Why did you choose that?<br>
        God gives you freedom to make choices—but that freedom comes with responsibility.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God’s Spirit leads us in a different way</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”<br>
        — Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        When you’re led by God’s Spirit, you will see fruit like self-control, peace, and kindness.<br>
        If your decisions are filled with anger, violence, fear, or pride, that’s not God’s will.<br>
        It’s not His Spirit guiding you—it’s your emotions, your flesh, your pain.<br><br>
        So, when you make a choice in that heated moment, ask:<br>
        What fruit is this decision bearing?
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">God can redeem our mistakes</p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him…”<br>
        — Romans 8:28 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Here’s the good news: God doesn’t waste a thing.<br>
        Even when we mess up, when our free will leads us down a painful road—He’s still with us.<br>
        He can turn what was meant for harm into something for good.<br>
        But first, we have to return to Him. We have to choose to surrender our choices to God, no matter how far we’ve strayed.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">PERSONAL REFLECTION: After Obasan Passed-away, I Had a Choice</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        When my Obasan passed away, the grief hit like a storm.<br>
        It shook me to my core. For the first time in my life, I faced the loss of someone so close. I questioned everything.<br>
        "God, why did You let this happen?"<br><br>
        And in the face of that pain, I had a choice.<br>
        I could choose to turn to God for comfort, to lean on Him for healing.<br>
        But I didn’t.<br>
        Instead, I chose to numb the pain. I sought distractions. I made poor choices. I tried to fill the emptiness with everything but God.<br><br>
        I told myself, “Maybe God’s will is for me to go through this pain…”<br><br>
        But as I look back now, I see the truth:<br>
        That wasn’t God’s will.<br>
        It was my own decision—my own free will at work.<br>
        I chose to run from God in my pain, to rely on myself.<br>
        And that choice hurt me more.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">LIFE EXAMPLE: The Slap That Wasn’t God's Plan</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Imagine this:<br>
        You’re angry. Someone says something that triggers you—something deeply personal, something unfair.<br>
        You lash out. You slap the person in the heat of the moment.<br><br>
        In that second, it feels almost right, doesn’t it?<br>
        You might even think, “Maybe God allowed me to do this to teach me something.”<br><br>
        But let’s stop for a second.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“The acts of the flesh are obvious: hatred, discord, fits of rage…”<br>
        — Galatians 5:19 (NIV)</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        That slap wasn’t God’s will.<br>
        It was human will—a decision made in the flesh, not the Spirit.<br>
        You can’t blame God for that.<br><br>
        But here’s the truth:<br>
        Even after we make those wrong choices—God still gives us a chance to choose again.<br>
        He doesn’t hold it against us. He just wants us to return to His peace, to His Spirit.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">THE LESSON: Stop Blaming God for What We Chose</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Here’s where we need to reflect:<br>
        When you mess up, do you own it?<br>
        Or do you push the blame on God, saying, “It was part of His plan”?<br><br>
        The reality is, we make decisions every day that shape our lives.<br>
        And we can’t keep blaming God for what was never His will in the first place.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">CONCLUSION: Walk in Faith, Not in Blame</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        The beauty of free will is that it’s yours—but it also means that you must take responsibility for it.<br>
        Every choice you make matters.<br>
        Every action carries weight.<br><br>
        Today, I want you to ask yourself:<br>
        "Am I truly choosing God's way, or am I just letting my emotions lead?"<br>
        "Am I blaming God for the mess I created, or am I willing to choose His peace again?"<br><br>
        God has given you the freedom to decide—you get to choose.<br>
        So, what will you choose today?<br><br>
        Don’t waste your free will blaming God for what’s been your choice.<br>
        Instead, choose faith, even after failure.<br>
        Choose peace, even after anger.<br>
        Choose healing, even after the hurt.<br><br>
        And remember, it’s never too late to choose again.

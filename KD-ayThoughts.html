      <h2 class="poem-title">Oil in the Chat Window – A Reflection on Matthew 25</h2>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        There was a time when someone reached out to me in the midst of his struggle. He was going through a heavy season of anxiety and depression, and his faith was shaken. He told me he had walked away from God because he couldn’t understand why a loving God would allow him to experience such deep pain. His heart was heavy, and he felt disconnected, alone, and unsure of where to turn.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        At that moment, I realized that he wasn’t asking for answers or for me to fix everything. He needed someone to listen, to hear his pain without judgment or immediate solutions. So, I did just that. I didn’t rush to give him Bible verses or try to explain his suffering. I simply validated his feelings, acknowledging that what he was going through was difficult and real. I knew that right then, he didn’t need preaching; he needed a presence, a listening ear, and compassion.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This experience reminded me of the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25:1–13. Jesus tells a story of ten virgins who are waiting for the bridegroom. Five were wise and had extra oil for their lamps, while the other five foolishly did not prepare. When the bridegroom came, those who had no oil were shut out, while the wise virgins were ready and went in to the celebration.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        In reflecting on this parable, I understood that being prepared isn’t just about having the right answers or knowledge. It’s about having enough oil in your lamp to sustain the light, even when things get dark. The oil in this story is not just a symbol of preparation but of readiness to offer something meaningful, even when we don’t have all the answers. The wise virgins didn’t just keep the oil for themselves—they were ready to enter the celebration, prepared to share in the joy of the bridegroom’s arrival.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        In the same way, when someone comes to us in his time of need, it’s not always about giving him the right verses or solutions. Sometimes, we are called to be the instrument of God’s presence. Our role isn’t to preach or force him into faith but to simply be there, offering the oil of patience, understanding, and love. We are the instruments through which God’s love can flow. Even when he isn’t ready for scripture, we can still be the hands and feet of Christ by being present, listening, and validating his feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        I remember how, in my conversation with him, I didn’t feel the need to impose scripture immediately. I knew he wasn’t in a place to receive it, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t speak words of hope and compassion. I simply reminded him that his pain was real, and it was okay to question. It was okay to feel lost or broken. I reassured him that, even when it felt like God was far, He was still there, even if it wasn’t always obvious. I wasn’t preaching at him. Instead, I became an instrument of God’s love in that moment, offering him the comfort of knowing he wasn’t alone, even in his doubt.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        I realized that, sometimes, our role as followers of Christ is not to force faith on someone but to become conduits of His presence.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        <em>“He comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.” – 2 Corinthians 1:4</em>
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        This comfort, this oil, is what we carry in moments of darkness. It’s not about having all the right answers, but about being prepared to offer the light we have, the oil in our lamps, to someone who is struggling.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Just as the wise virgins were prepared for the bridegroom’s arrival, we are called to be prepared—prepared to offer empathy, compassion, and the love of Christ. We may not always have the right words, but our presence, our willingness to listen, and our commitment to walk alongside someone in his pain are enough.
      </p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Through this, I understood that being an instrument of the Lord is not about forcing faith onto someone. It’s about allowing God’s love to flow through us, offering peace, understanding, and compassion when others are in need. And even when he’s not ready for scripture, when he feels disconnected or lost, we can still be a reflection of His love—ready, waiting, and prepared to show His presence in a way he can receive.

      <h2 class="poem-title">When the Night Was Too Heavy to Carry</h2>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">Reflection</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Last night was one of those nights.<br><br>
    
        I’m not used to sleeping with a heavy heart — I usually make it a point to end my day in peace.<br>
        But yesterday, something inside me was unbearably heavy.<br>
        Even when I tried to sleep, it kept waking me up — gasping for air, chasing my breath in the middle of the night.<br><br>
    
        Around 1 or 2 AM, I couldn’t take it anymore.<br><br>
    
        I prayed silently, surrendering it again to the Lord —<br>
        because truthfully, I had already surrendered it.<br>
        I fully trusted Him.<br>
        But humans are still humans.<br><br>
    
        Even when we’ve already laid it down at His feet, emotions can still flood us —<br>
        especially when it’s a pain born out of love.<br><br>
    
        I decided to move.<br>
        I decided to be closer to where my heart was.<br><br>
    
        I went with my dad to the cemetery.<br><br>
    
        And when I arrived there, the weight became too much —<br>
        I called a friend.<br><br>
    
        That’s when I broke down.<br>
        I cried and cried until I couldn’t breathe.<br>
        And honestly, I wasn’t searching for answers at that moment.<br>
        Maybe I just needed a reminder that I wasn’t alone.<br><br>
    
        I just needed a presence — even if it was through a call —<br>
        to help me release what I could no longer carry alone.<br><br>
    
        I didn’t mean to make anyone worry.<br>
        I wasn’t trying to burden anyone with my sadness.<br>
        I just... needed to release the pain.<br><br>
    
        After a while, I drove back home briefly to get my Bible, which I had forgotten.<br>
        The call stayed connected — and somehow, even just hearing someone’s voice calmed the storm inside my heart.<br><br>
    
        After getting my Bible, my friend ended the call, and I made my way to my dad’s apartment.<br>
        I had already decided to sleep there every night now.<br><br>
    
        Because two nights ago, my little sister couldn’t sleep — she cried, missing our dad so much.<br>
        And I couldn’t bear the thought of her sleeping with a heavy heart again.<br>
        I wanted to be there — for her, for my mom, for us.<br><br>
    
        When I arrived at the apartment, the emotions overflowed again.<br><br>
    
        I cried —<br>
        this time, letting it all out, no pretending.<br>
        I called my friend again — not for advice, not for solutions,<br>
        but just to have someone listen in the middle of my breaking.<br><br>
    
        After the tears settled, I prayed.<br><br>
    
        And I opened my Bible — asking God to meet me where I was.<br><br>
    
        Out of nowhere, my eyes landed on Exodus 14:14:
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-scripture">
        “The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.” (NIV)
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And somehow, something inside me began to settle.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">Personal Realizations</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Maybe that’s what I needed to remember:<br><br>
    
        That even after surrendering everything to God,<br>
        it’s okay to feel.<br>
        It’s okay to break sometimes.<br>
        It’s okay to cry even when you trust Him completely.<br><br>
    
        Faith doesn’t erase emotions.<br>
        Faith holds you steady through them.<br><br>
    
        "You don’t have to fight anymore. Be still. Let Me fight for you."<br>
        That's what God was whispering to my weary heart.<br><br>
    
        And in that moment, I realized something else too —<br>
        I am deeply grateful.<br><br>
    
        Grateful for my family — for my mom and little sister, who unknowingly give me strength to keep going every day.<br>
        Grateful for my friend, who stayed on the line and listened, without judgment, without rushing me.<br>
        Grateful to a person who means a lot to me — that, even without knowing everything that's happening inside me, always reminds me to take care of myself.<br><br>
    
        Especially when I go outside at night —<br>
        always checking, always caring from afar in the quietest, simplest ways.<br><br>
    
        Those small reminders, those silent presences —<br>
        they meant more than words could ever say.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class="poem-section">Life Lesson Reminders</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        Surrender doesn't mean you won't feel pain.<br>
        Even when we fully trust God, our hearts still carry emotions. It's part of being human.

      <p class="poem-line">
        Presence is sometimes the best comfort.<br>
        You don't always have to say anything. Sometimes just being there — even through a phone call — can be enough.

        God fights battles we can't even see.<br>

        God stays close when you feel most broken.<br>

      <p class="poem-line">
        Stillness is an act of faith.<br>
        You don't have to solve everything tonight. You just need to be still — and let God carry the rest.

      <h3 class="poem-section">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="poem-line">
        That night, nothing in the situation magically changed.<br>
        The ache was still there.<br>
        The absence was still painfully real.<br><br>
    
        But something inside me shifted.<br><br>
    
        The burden wasn’t mine to carry anymore.<br><br>
    
        I surrendered it again.<br>
        I trusted again.<br>
        And I chose to be still — because I realized that God was already fighting for me, even when all I could do was cry.<br><br>
    
        And somehow, as I laid beside my mom and little sister, hearing their quiet breathing,<br>
        I knew —<br><br>
    
        Peace isn’t the absence of pain.<br>
        Peace is the presence of God, holding you even when the pain is loud.<br><br>
    
        And tonight, because of Him —<br>
        and because of the people He quietly placed around me —<br>
        it was enough.

      <p class="poem-subtitle">A Reflection on Obedience, Timing, and Becoming</p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        I have someone who means a lot to me.<br>
        Not someone I casually stumbled upon—<br>
        but someone whose presence felt like answered prayer.<br>
        And yet, in the middle of that sweet unfolding,<br>
        we chose silence.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        Not because the feelings faded.<br>
        Not because the connection broke.<br>
        But because obedience spoke louder than our hearts could whisper.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        It’s hard—<br>
        to go from conversations that felt like home<br>
        to waking up and saying nothing.<br>
        To see their name and not reach out.<br>
        To hold back the urge to say, “I miss you,”<br>
        because you know that God's timing is more important than your timing.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And so, we stopped.<br>
        Not because we wanted to end the story,<br>
        but because we didn’t want to write the wrong chapter with our own hands.<br>
        Because we know what happens when people force what isn't yet confirmed.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        I think of David—he wasn’t chasing the throne.<br>
        He was just tending sheep, unnoticed,<br>
        but God whispered, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”

        I think of Joseph—he didn’t campaign for power.<br>
        He was betrayed, sold, forgotten.<br>
        Yet God said, “You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.”

        And now I understand—<br>
        You don’t have to chase what’s already in God’s hands.<br>
        You don’t have to force a connection that God is still preparing.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        Because waiting isn't just waiting.<br>
        It’s preparing.<br>
        It’s sharpening character in silence.<br>
        It’s becoming someone who can carry a promise without letting it become an idol.<br><br>
        It’s learning to pray more than pursue,<br>
        to worship more than wish,<br>
        to build more than beg.

        Maybe this is what love looks like in its holy form:<br>

        it doesn’t end in cliffhangers.<br>
        It ends in fulfillment.<br>
        No confusion. No compromise. Just clarity and peace.

        <em>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.”<br>
        —Galatians 6:9, NIV</em>
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And to the one I had to let go of for now:<br><br>
        I see your love for Jesus.<br>
        You don’t just attend church; you are the Church.<br>
        You don’t just serve; you surrender.<br>
        You don’t just speak faith; you walk it, breathe it, live it.<br>
        You are a woman of the Word,<br>
        and I deeply respect that.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        I thank God for your life.<br>
        Because unknowingly, you became a vessel.<br>
        I already honored God with my life,<br>
        but when I started talking to you,<br>
        He showed me something deeper—<br>
        that even my words must honor Him.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        That it’s not enough to worship in song,<br>
        if my speech sounds like the world.<br>
        Through you, I was reminded of what Pastor Vinz once said:<br>
        “Speak like Jesus.”
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And that convicted me more than any rebuke ever could.<br>
        Without correction, I was refined.<br>
        Not through rules, but through your reflection of Him.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        And if the silence is what keeps both of us aligned with God’s voice,<br>
        then may the silence continue—<br>
        until the right time, the right season, the right call.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        No, I’m not just waiting.<br>
        I’m preparing.<br>
        Not just dreaming of what could be,<br>
        but letting God deal with what needs to be.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        I want to meet the future with peace—<br>
        not the pressure to prove,<br>
        but the assurance that we both followed God, not feelings.
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        So until then,<br>
        I won’t reach for what’s unclear.<br>
        I’ll reach for the One who sees all things clearly.<br>
        And if the path ever crosses again,<br>
        it will be because God brought it back—not me.
      </p>

        —Proverbs 3:5–6, NIV</em>
      </p>
    
      <p class="poem-line">
        So here I am, Lord—<br>
        Not chasing.<br>
        Not begging.<br>
        Just becoming.<br>
        Still.<br>
        Faithful.<br>
        And fully Yours.

        And to you—<br>
        if ever there’s a day you need a friend,<br>
        know that you can always reach out.<br>
        My Instagram is open.<br><br>
        No pressure. No expectation.<br>
        Just one heart rooting for another—<br>
        in faith, in friendship, in Christ.

        <h2 class="poem-title">Religion Won’t Save You – But This Will</h2>
        <h3 class="poem-section">(My Personal Reflection)</h3>
      
        <p class="poem-line">
          I was just scrolling through Instagram, not really looking for anything in particular, when I came across a post that asked, <br>
          “Does religion still matter?” <br>
          That question stopped me. <br>
          It hit something deep inside me. <br>
          And it made me pause, reflect, and write this.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          This is my point of view, not to force anyone to believe like I do, but to help someone think, reflect, and maybe even find what their heart’s been searching for.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because here’s what I’ve come to realize: <br>
          Religion alone is not enough.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Yes—religion matters. It has value. It can guide us, teach us, and lead us. <br>
          But religion itself cannot save you. <br>
          At best, it’s a tool. A map. A pathway. <br>
          But the destination? <br>
          The true goal? <br>
          Is a relationship with the living God.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          There are so many religions in the world. <br>
          Each claiming to offer the truth. <br>
          Each with its own teachings, rituals, and roadmaps to peace, salvation, or purpose. <br>
          It can get overwhelming—like a spiritual maze.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          But I’ve learned this: <br>
          It’s not about religion. It’s about connection.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because you can follow all the rituals… <br>
          Obey all the rules… <br>
          Recite all the prayers… <br>
          And still not know God.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Matthew 15:8 (NIV):<br>“These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.”</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So is religion important? Yes. <br>
          But only if it brings you closer to God. <br>
          Only if it helps you know Him, love Him, walk with Him.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          I’m not here to say all religions are the same. <br>
          Because the truth is—the path you choose matters. <br>
          Not all roads lead to life. <br>
          Not all belief systems reflect the heart of the true God.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          That’s why we have to be intentional. <br>
          Ask questions. Seek. Learn. Pray.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because when you choose a religion, you’re not just choosing a label. <br>
          You’re choosing a direction— <br>
          A direction that should lead you to truth, to freedom, to love… <br>
          To God Himself.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Jeremiah 29:13 (NIV):<br>"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          This is why I made this reflection. <br>
          To remind myself—and maybe you too— <br>
          That we weren’t created just to follow a religion… <br>
          We were created for a relationship. <br>
          A living, breathing, daily walk with the One who formed our soul.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV):<br>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          You can’t earn His love. <br>
          You can’t pray your way into heaven with the perfect formula. <br>
          You can’t belong to the “right religion” and think that’s enough.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          Because in the end, you won’t stand before God and be asked: <br>
          “What religion were you?” <br>
          You’ll be asked: <br>
          “Did you know Me?”
        </p>
        <p class="poem-scripture">John 17:3 (NIV):<br>"Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."</p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          So yes—choose a religion. <br>
          Choose one that teaches truth, that brings light, that points to grace. <br>
          But never forget: <br>
          It’s not the religion that saves you— <br>
          It’s the relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="poem-line">
          And that relationship is always available. <br>
          No matter your past. <br>
          No matter your doubts. <br>
          No matter how far you’ve wandered. <br>
          God is near. And He’s not waiting for your perfection— <br>
          He’s just waiting for your heart.
